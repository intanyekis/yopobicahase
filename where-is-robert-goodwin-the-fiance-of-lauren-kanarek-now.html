Robert Goodwin, the equestrian’s fiancé, was nearby and managed to restrain the shooter until the police arrived. ’48 Hours: The Shooting of Lauren Kanarek’ on CBS News explores the circumstances leading up to the shooting and its fallout. So this is all we know about Robert’s subsequent events in case you were wondering.</p><figure id=attachment_60552 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-60552 class="wp-caption aligncenter">Lauren Kanarek</figure><h2>Robert Goodwin: Who is He?</h2><p>Lauren Karanek began working out at Michael Barisone’s farm in Washington Township, New Jersey, in March 2018. Michael is a well-known dressage trainer. Together with her fiancé, Robert Goodwin, she also resided on the property. Although Lauren and Michael’s relationship had a promising beginning, by the summer of 2019, it had become hopelessly dysfunctional. The pair refused to leave the house despite Michael’s requests for them to do so.</p><p>Prior to the incident, Michael stated he had expressed his concern for his life to the police. Later, according to his lawyer, Lauren and Robert installed covert listening devices in order to record his talks and harass him. The pair was also charged by the attorney with reporting alleged code breaches, which led to a visit from the authorities the day before the shooting. The next accusation against Robert was that he told Michael to “Get ready” as he formed the shape of a gun with his fingers.</p><p>On August 7, 2019, Michael left his office with a 9mm handgun and drove to the residence where Lauren and Robert were staying. When Lauren started talking to Michael, he was hiding behind a bush next to the back porch. Then, according to her, Michael allegedly drew a revolver and shot her twice. Robert reported seeing Michael with a weapon. Attempting to shoot Robert as well, the trainer missed and instead struck a windowpane.</p><p>Lauren contacted 911 after being shot, identifying Michael as the assailant. Robert picked up the phone and claimed to be holding Michael down while on top of him. Robert said in later evidence that he initially hit Michael before placing the trainer in a chokehold when the latter turned around. Robert had Michael pinned on the ground when the police showed there. During the struggle, Robert broke his wrist.</p><h2>Regarding Lauren Kanarek:</h2><p>Dressage rider Lauren Kanarek was shot on Wednesday at Barisone Dressage, a riding arena in Morris County, New Jersey. Former American Olympian Michael Barisone, the facility’s owner, has been charged with two charges of attempted murder and two counts of weapon offenses. He has been accused of shooting her.</p><p>Her condition is stable, according to Facebook posts from her friends.</p><p>The Livingston, Scotland-born, double-award-winning equestrienne, 38, was shot twice on August 7 at 2:15 p.m. She had at least occasionally resided on the farm in New Jersey.</p><p>In 1998, Kanarek attended Livingston Senior High School in New Jersey. He later studied political science at Hollins University in Roanoke, Virginia, and legal procedure at Guilford College in Greensboro, North Carolina.</p><p>Her fiance, who sustained a broken wrist, was one of two other victims hurt in the incident. While Lauren’s fiancé was attempting to disarm Michael Barisone, another person was hurt: Michael.</p><h2>Lauren Kanarek When Dressage</h2><p>Kanarek was trained with Michael Barisone with the goal of becoming an instructor while competing in dressage.</p><h2>Condition of Lauren Kanarek</h2><p>Kanarek is doing well, her pals have reported via Facebook posts.</p><h2>Medals for Lauren Kanarek: Bronze</h2><p>The American Dressage Federation awarded Kanarek a bronze medal.</p><h2>Michael Barisone: Who is He?</h2><p>54-year-old Barisone Dressage is owned and run by Michael Barisone in Long Valley. He was a part of the American Olympic squad in 2008, but as there were only three combinations allowed per team, he did not ride. His riding teammates were Courtney King-Dye on Mytilus, Steffen Peters on Ravel, and Debbie McDonald on Brentina.</p><p>A firearm was found at the site, along with the defendant, Michael Barisone, and a second male victim. The suspect was remained in detention as of August 8 according to the Morris County Prosecutor’s Office, but no official charges had been brought.</p><h2>Arrest of Michael Barisone</h2><p>A firearm was found at the site, along with the defendant, Michael Barisone, and a second male victim. The suspect was remained in detention as of August 8 according to the Morris County Prosecutor’s Office, but no official charges had been brought.</p><h2>Charges by Michael Barisone</h2><p>The charges were officially announced by Morris County Prosecutor Fredric M. Knapp, Acting Chief of Investigations for the Morris County Prosecutor’s Office Christoph Kimker, and Chief Jeffrey Almer of the Washington Township Police Department.</p><p>The defendant was accused of two counts of attempted murder, a first-degree crime, and two counts of illegally possessing a weapon, a second-degree offense.</p><h2>John Barisone Hearing</h2><p>On Friday, August 9, Michael is anticipated to be charged in Morris County Court. He could spend up to life in jail if found guilty.</p><p>An equestrian center in Morris County, New Jersey called Barisone Dressage is where Lauren Kanarek, a competitive dressage rider, was shot twice in the chest on August 7. Owner of the institution and former American Olympian Michael Barisone is charged with shooting her. According to NJ Media, he is accused with two charges of attempted murder.</p><p>According to officials, 54-year-old Barisone is also accused with two counts of criminal use of a weapon. Kanarek, 38, was taken to the hospital after the incident. She is stable, according to numerous of her friends’ Facebook posts.</p><p>Kanarek published a number of mysterious statements on Facebook in the weeks before she was shot. I’ll provide my tests, reads one such August 5 status. If for no other reason than to demonstrate this, I’ll perform the task myself if a trainer refuses to do it despite being paid outrageous sums of money! #eyeontheball”</p><p>“Hmmm…A certain renowned drunk—has literally just instructed me’sleep with one eye open,’” Kanarek posted on August 2. Breaking news: I don’t sleep! But I’ll be alert for any wine boxes that aren’t properly aimed.</p><p>Finally, earlier that day on August 2, Kanarek said, “I’m being bullied by a 6’3 man. The extent of the bullying worries me. It’s quite convoluted; I’m not sure what I can say, but it appears that Safe Sport was established for this specific purpose.</p><p>Several publications have also claimed that Kanarek reported Barisone to SafeSport, which compiles assault and misconduct reports from Olympic sports, or that she intended to do so.</p><h2>Barisone has been Accused of Abusing Kanarek</h2><p>Since then, a large number of Kanarek’s friends have corroborated that she was the one shot at the equestrian center. One of these friends claims that Kanarek and Barisone had a “ongoing argument” before to her being shot and that Barisone had previously threatened to kill Kanarek.</p><p>My friend Lauren Kanarek was shot twice in the heart by her trainer Michael Barisone yesterday. Michael’s customer Lauren temporarily resided on his property with her horses. Michael was taken into custody right away for shooting Lauren. They had a running argument that got so bad Lauren had to employ attorneys and report Michael to Safe Sport, USEF, and FEI.</p><p>Lauren and her family have received death threats from Michael, who also advised her to keep one eye open while sleeping.</p><p>When Lauren’s fiancé tried to pull the gun from Michael’s hands, Michael also fractured his wrist.</p><p>Lauren underwent surgery last night and recovered overnight. She’s still unconscious, and her condition is critical.</p><p>Please wish Lauren good health. Right now, she needs all the assistance and backing she can get.<br>I also sincerely hope that this doesn’t degenerate into yet another popularity contest in opposition to the unavoidable facts of attempted murder.</p><p>On her Facebook page, Lauren has publicly discussed her ongoing issues with Michael. You can read her posts there without a problem; I even have screen images. There are no winners in this terrible circumstance.</p><p>Since being arrested, Barisone has remained silent in public.</p><p>Rosanna Williams, a friend of Kanarek’s, told The New York Post, “She’s really compassionate. She has put a lot of effort into the sport. I am unable to talk about the trigger that caused this. The circumstance was exceedingly complicated.</p><p>Kanarek routinely posts pictures and videos of her riding activities on Twitter and Instagram.</p><p>Kanarek is reportedly engaged to be married and has attended both Hollins University and Guilford College.</p><h2>Michael Bonarise Has a Long Resume in Equestrian Sports Barisone</h2><p>‌The building where Kanarek was shot is owned by Barisone Dressage.</p><p>Barisone participated in the dressage competition at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing on horseback (his team did not medal). He now works out of his own facilities in Florida and New Jersey and is a well-known trainer for other top riders on horses.</p><p>A member of the 1997 Nations Cup team that won the gold medal at Hickstead, Barisone has won over 100 CDI Grand Prix races on nine different horses that he “developed himself,” according to his official biography. The 2009 Sportsman International Horseman of the Year award went to him as well. Younger Olympians he has coached include Alison Brock, who helped the United States win bronze at the 2016 Olympics in Rio.</p><p>A select few accounts have continually justified the shooter’s acts, angering several members of the equestrian community in the process.</p><p>Lauren Kanarek pushed her bullying too far, according to Dressage Hub, a Twitter account with over 11,000 followers that focuses on the equestrian community. Everyone is constrained. Dressage Hub fully backs Michael Barisone’s decisions.</p><p>Users instantly reacted, criticizing the comment’s apparent harshness. To be clear, you endorse someone shooting a woman in the chest twice, one person remarked.</p><p>Another person said, “He shot her twice in the chest? How is this even slightly acceptable? How on earth do you defend that. Disgusting.”</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thetalkstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1663445603_671_Where-is-Robert-Goodwin-The-Fiance-of-Lauren-Kanarek-Now.png></p><h2>Where is Robert Goodwin?</h2><p>Although Lauren and Robert gave testimony on behalf of the prosecution, the jury eventually chose the defense. Michael Barisone was cleared of trying to kill Lauren and Robert in April 2022 thanks to the success of the temporary insanity defense. Despite not being temporarily insane, Michael was not found guilty of trying to kill Robert. Naturally, Robert has kept a low profile ever since. Although he has not been active on social media, it is clear that he enjoys horses and food trucks. He is still with Lauren, as far as we can ascertain, and his last known whereabouts is still New Jersey.</p><h2>Bio of Lauren Kanarek</h2><table id=tablepress-168 class="tablepress tablepress-id-168"><tbody class=row-hover readability=4.5><tr class="row-1 odd"><td class=column-1 colspan=2>Wiki Bio</td></tr><tr class="row-2 even"><td class=column-1>Full Birth Name</td><td class=column-2>Brendan Quinn Scanzano</td></tr><tr class="row-3 odd"><td class=column-1>Nickname</td><td class=column-2>Brendan</td></tr><tr class="row-4 even"><td class=column-1>Occupation</td><td class=column-2>Reality Star,</td></tr><tr class="row-5 odd" readability=2><td class=column-1>Famous For</td><td class=column-2>Being as a contestant of The Bachelorette season 17</td></tr><tr class="row-6 even"><td class=column-1>Age (As of 2021)</td><td class=column-2>26 years old.</td></tr><tr class="row-7 odd"><td class=column-1>Date of Birth</td><td class=column-2>Not Known.</td></tr><tr class="row-8 even"><td class=column-1>Birthplace/Hometown</td><td class=column-2>Toronto, Ontario, Canada</td></tr><tr class="row-9 odd"><td class=column-1>Nationality</td><td class=column-2>American</td></tr><tr class="row-10 even"><td class=column-1>Religion</td><td class=column-2>Christian.</td></tr><tr class="row-11 odd"><td class=column-1>Ethnicity</td><td class=column-2>White.</td></tr><tr class="row-12 even"><td class=column-1>Gender</td><td class=column-2>Male</td></tr><tr class="row-13 odd" readability=3><td class=column-1>Sexuality (Straight, Gay or Lesbian)</td><td class=column-2>Straight</td></tr><tr class="row-14 even"><td class=column-1>Zodiac Birth Sign</td><td class=column-2>Not Known.</td></tr><tr class="row-15 odd"><td class=column-1>House Location</td><td class=column-2>Toronto, Ontario, Canada</td></tr><tr class="row-16 even"><td class=column-1>Net Worth</td><td class=column-2>Not Known</td></tr><tr class="row-17 odd"><td class=column-1 colspan=2>Physical Statistics</td></tr><tr class="row-18 even" readability=2><td class=column-1>Weight</td><td class=column-2>Kilograms:&nbsp;Kg.<p>Pounds:&nbsp;lbs.</p></td></tr><tr class="row-19 odd"><td class=column-1>Eye Color</td><td class=column-2>Hazel.</td></tr><tr class="row-20 even"><td class=column-1>Hair Color</td><td class=column-2>Brown.</td></tr><tr class="row-21 odd" readability=2><td class=column-1 colspan=2>Personal Life Relationship</td></tr><tr class="row-22 even"><td class=column-1>Marital Status</td><td class=column-2>Unmarried.</td></tr><tr class="row-23 odd"><td class=column-1>Girlfriend/ Affair</td><td class=column-2>Not Known</td></tr><tr class="row-24 even"><td class=column-1>Siblings</td><td class=column-2>Not Known</td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGiuoZ2imnqqv4yrppudoql6qLvOna6ipl2ptaZ5xaKYp5uVYrynecuarKudnmK4orrAq5ykZZ6kxHA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhere-is-robert-goodwin-the-fiance-of-lauren-kanarek-now.html&text=Where%20is%20Robert%20Goodwin%2c%20The%20Fianc%20of%20Lauren%20Kanarek%20Now%3f%20The%20Talks%20Today&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhere-is-robert-goodwin-the-fiance-of-lauren-kanarek-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-is-robert-goodwin-the-fiance-of-lauren-kanarek-now.html&title=Where%20is%20Robert%20Goodwin%2c%20The%20Fianc%20of%20Lauren%20Kanarek%20Now%3f%20The%20Talks%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhere-is-robert-goodwin-the-fiance-of-lauren-kanarek-now.html&title=Where%20is%20Robert%20Goodwin%2c%20The%20Fianc%20of%20Lauren%20Kanarek%20Now%3f%20The%20Talks%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-is-robert-goodwin-the-fiance-of-lauren-kanarek-now.html&title=Where%20is%20Robert%20Goodwin%2c%20The%20Fianc%20of%20Lauren%20Kanarek%20Now%3f%20The%20Talks%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhere-is-robert-goodwin-the-fiance-of-lauren-kanarek-now.html&description=Where%20is%20Robert%20Goodwin%2c%20The%20Fianc%20of%20Lauren%20Kanarek%20Now%3f%20The%20Talks%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-things-lisa-kudrow-has-been-up-to-since-friends-ended.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Things Lisa Kudrow Has Been Up To Since Friends Ended">&larr;
