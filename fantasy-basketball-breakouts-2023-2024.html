The efficiency gains were enormous, as he finished 51/34/90 compared to 45/30/81 in 2021. He finished with 1 block per game, the first time over 0.8. He literally contributed everywhere without hurting anywhere.</li><li aria-level=1><b><a class=ath_autolink data-id=3KAZAQAjmgeKKdDD href=#>Jaren Jackson Jr.</a> (103 ADP – No. 12 ranking</b>) — Scored two more points per game due to an increase in efficiency from 41% to 50%. He grabbed one more rebound per game and the blocks spiked from 2.3 to 3.</li><li aria-level=1><b><a class=ath_autolink data-id=Ji3rG8vmasLxNWy8 href=#>Lauri Markkanen</a> (82 ADP – No. 19 ranking)</b> — Traded from Cleveland to Utah, where he played 3.6 more minutes and saw a 6.8% usage bump. Shot a career-high 49% from the field, the 25.6 ppg marked the first time over 20 ppg and the rebounds increased from 5.7 to 8.6.</li><li aria-level=1><b><a class=ath_autolink data-id=47D5hSormvUQWaZj href=#>Nic Claxton</a> (110 ADP – No. 24 ranking)</b> — Became the bona fide No. 1 guy for the first time, starting all 76 games he played and seeing an increase of 9.2 minutes per game. Led the league in field goal percentage and provided the things you want from bigs: boards and blocks.</li><li aria-level=1><b><a class=ath_autolink data-id=dmZgViDJ3He5ZrQp href=#>Mikal Bridges</a> (66 ADP – No. 32 ranking)</b> — Saw an increase in usage rate right before the trade deadline in Phoenix. Once he was traded to Brooklyn, it was wheels up. After being a 15-ish usage guy for most of his career, that number spiked to 30 with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=70 href=#>Brooklyn</a>, and he was able to thrive in the role.</li><li aria-level=1><b><a class=ath_autolink data-id=OHIwHNCdjPaGfh6W href=#>Trey Murphy III</a> (179 ADP – No. 45 ranking)</b> — Was thrust into a starting role, averaging 31 minutes per game, and flourished. He shot 48/40/90 with 6.3 attempts from downtown per game.</li><li aria-level=1><b><a class=ath_autolink data-id=sEPJ8c4zyGQqzxpE href=#>Cameron Johnson</a> (109 ADP – No. 54 ranking)</b> — After averaging around 25 minutes per game with the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=91 href=#>Suns</a>, he garnered 30.8 after being traded to the Nets. Johnson averaged 2.1 dimes per game, the first time over 2.</li><li aria-level=1><b><a class=ath_autolink data-id=QJCTnsvWhhoDUYd0 href=#>Walker Kessler</a> (137 ADP – No. 57 ranking)</b> — There were playing time concerns for the rookie and questions about how his historic blocking prowess in college would translate. Kessler ended up starting 40 of 74 games, averaging 23 minutes and 2.3 blocks per game.</li><li aria-level=1><b><a class=ath_autolink data-id=z2FafX0QarjHmDDy href=#>Jalen Williams</a> (176 ADP – No. 73 ranking)</b> — As with Kessler, there were concerns about playing time as a rookie. Williams ended up starting 62 of 75 games and averaged 30.3 minutes while shooting an impressive 52/35/81. Like with SGA, he contributed everywhere without hurting anywhere. That Sam Presti is pretty good at what he does.</li></ul><p>The Shai bump was surprising because he was already at such a high level, but he was still so young. The JJJ ascension was easier to digest because bigs take some time to develop and he had increased the block rate the prior season. Claxton was the easiest to forecast because of the depth chart. Markkanen was murky because of the uncertainty of a new situation, but the risk/reward ratio definitely increased for the better. Bridges, Murphy and Cam Johnson were situations that were impossible to predict because of injuries and trades. Kessler and Jalen Williams were rookies and, historically, rookies have had a difficult time making an impact early on.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>In the below piece, I will do my best to identify players who may take the next step in their development or are in situations that may afford them more opportunities. Players will be listed by team. ADP will once again be courtesy of NFBKC for eight drafts from June 1 to September 28. Keep in mind that these drafts are 8-cat, Roto and require two centers.</p><p><b><a class=ath_autolink data-id=1li2WZ1BSYZ7fGTT href=#>Saddiq Bey</a>, ATL (126 ADP)</b> — With <a class=ath_autolink data-id=clt53Cta3GNiC4xs href=#>John Collins</a> now in Utah, Bey has an opportunity to soak up most of the power forward minutes in Atlanta. His ability to space the floor (40% from downtown last season) should give him the upper hand over <a class=ath_autolink data-id=8NJqtnAi9XizxIZP href=#>Jalen Johnson</a>. After shooting near 40% from the field for most of his career, he converted 47% of his attempts last season. Playing alongside <a class=ath_autolink data-id=pMqz7IIVkDhPCk6P href=#>Trae Young</a> will provide plenty of good looks.</p><p><b><a class=ath_autolink data-id=1gvi2qXedwaFkKdP href=#>Mark Williams</a>, CHA (94 ADP)</b> — Steve Clifford has been tough on rookies during his coaching career, but he’s been fair, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">stating</a>, “they have a chance every day to prove their worth through everything they do; arriving on time, attentiveness in film sessions, knowing the scouting repot and their level of play in 3 on 3 scrimmages during shootaround.”</p><p>Playing time is earned, and that’s what Williams did in his rookie season. After being inactive for much of the first two months, he started playing in the teens (minutes) then eventually garnered playing time in the high-20s to end the season. And he produced. There isn’t much competition on the depth chart and the return of <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ovP4Zjm8PFLcjKlm href=#>LaMelo Ball</a> to the mix should make his life easier on the offensive end.</p><p><b><a class=ath_autolink data-id=i4CkBlJak1Vr3vVR href=#>Richaun Holmes</a>, DAL (146 ADP)</b> — I was pretty excited for Holmes early in the offseason, but that has dissipated somewhat after Jason Kidd mentioned that he may start Derek Lively. That said, I still have some doubts that Lively will make a significant impact this season. I will be getting some Lively shares to hedge, though. Holmes was terrible at the end of his run in Sacramento due to a multitude of factors: there were off-the-court issues, injuries and a scheme change in Sacramento. He has shown that he can play in the league, though, and I think he would be a potent offensive piece alongside <a class=ath_autolink data-id=gMyReUOesjAikT7S href=#>Luka Doncic</a>. Don’t forget that he’s had two Top 40 finishes in the past.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><b><a class=ath_autolink data-id=RZq0RaKHJrTHmA2i href=#>Isaiah Stewart</a>, DET (146 ADP)</b> — Troy Weaver loves Stewart and lauds him for his work ethic. He’s been so happy with his progress that he rewarded him with a four-year, $64 million extension in July. Stewart is slated to be the starting power forward for the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=76 href=#>Pistons</a> and averaging 30 minutes doesn’t seem far fetched. While he’s not an expert shooter from downtown yet (32%), he does have the ability to space the floor, unlike Marvin Bagley. It wouldn’t be a surprise to see increases in efficiency due to his work ethic and the return of <a class=ath_autolink data-id=xKlJ0Tp1E53cb36Q href=#>Cade Cunningham</a> to the offensive mix.</p><p><b><a class=ath_autolink data-id=c2JzOuogTXer3fD4 href=#>Alperen Sengun</a>, HOU (54 ADP)</b> — Sengun may be priced correctly, so the final spread between preseason ADP and final ranking may be minimal. That said, I do think there’s a chance that Sengun takes that next step up. For starters, he’s extremely talented and skilled. Head coach Ime Udoka has acknowledged that, and I think he will maximize his strengths on both ends of the court. Udoka has talked about utilizing him more like <a class=ath_autolink data-id=bCjsyLGuQMrMSWNr href=#>Nikola Jokic</a> on offense and eschewing drop coverage on defense.</p><p><b><a class=ath_autolink data-id=sbpm1Ty4vmeY5sa9 href=#>Chet Holmgren</a>, OKC (55 ADP)</b> — Holmgren will technically be a rookie after missing all of last season due to injury. He’s not cheap, considering the injury history, but the upside is sky-high. With his awareness, length and ability to change the geometry on the defensive end, Holmgren should get plenty of rebounds and blocks. It’s on offense where he could really thrive. Holmgren does have the ability to shoot from downtown, but with all the playmakers on the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=80 href=#>Thunder</a> and the type of offense they run, he could get so many easy looks.</p><p><b><a class=ath_autolink data-id=sUx6k2FCcIJvJV6W href=#>Franz Wagner</a>; <a class=ath_autolink data-id=4AtM6kuhg6XMXsS1 href=#>Paolo Banchero</a>, ORL (62 ADP)</b> — Franz and Paolo have been going right next to each other in early drafts. I’m not sure how much better Franz can get because he’s already at a high level. Wait, isn’t that what was said of Shai last season? I’m definitely not seeing a Shai-like elevation, but it’s well within the range of outcomes that Franz averages over 20 points per game and increases the dimes and blocks. He has great length, tremendous IQ and is a very good defender.</p><p>As for Paolo, it all comes down to efficiency and defensive numbers. I’m not sure about his defensive contributions increasing, but I think the efficiency gets much better this season. The Team USA experience will have been a great experience for him and, at his size, he can get easier looks.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><b><a class=ath_autolink data-id=ZaAqNko77dWsPkHu href=#>Tyrese Maxey</a>, PHI (64 ADP)</b> — This recommendation is predicated on the Sixers trading <a class=ath_autolink data-id=xj359Qh34ugWFbVp href=#>James Harden</a> and not receiving a high-usage guard in return. If so, then Maxey has a chance of truly breaking out. He has tremendous speed, which helps him in transition and getting his shot up in the half court. For a player his size, shooting 48% from the field is… dare I say, Shai-esque. He could see a usage rate increase and 20+ points, 3 boards, 5 dimes and 1 steal aren’t out of the question.</p><p><b><a class=ath_autolink data-id=dwN9nKEOhpd6ywcf href=#>Paul Reed</a>, PHI (179 ADP)</b> — The ADP has spiked recently after Nick Nurse said that he may play Reed at power forward alongside <a class=ath_autolink data-id=jcKI7IrySH9vZuXQ href=#>Joel Embiid</a>. That could mean one minute or 20. I honestly don’t know what to make of this situation. Reed has often been a darling of the fantasy community but there’s a reason he hasn’t averaged more than 10 minutes per game in a season. Could it be coaching? Sure. Could it be things that we are not privy to behind the scenes? Definitely.</p><p>When I have seen Reed on the court, he has definitely flashed, but sometimes things change when a player is elevated into a higher role. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=5CFahTjQetcnpOqe href=#>Jalen Smith</a> anyone? That said, minutes are gold and opportunity is king, so if Nurse is enamored with Reed and gives him the playing time, then Reed will smash his ADP. There’s also a chance that Nurse is just talking up a player in the offseason and, when things get real or he has had more exposure to Reed, that he remains a fringe player. This one comes down to cost and garnering more information.</p><p><b><a class=ath_autolink data-id=PlF5bckQOtrRhpgu href=#>Deandre Ayton</a>, POR (66 ADP)</b> — Ayton is going from a team with high-usage players in <a class=ath_autolink data-id=4wodYWTaBEfNXJjo href=#>Devin Booker</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ho6h1sijyi2PAURU href=#>Kevin Durant</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=mb7gZfksSkvZCBxf href=#>Bradley Beal</a> to a Portland team that is young, developing and not looking to win right now. Ayton should see an increase in usage rate, which could get him to be more engaged at both ends of the floor.</p><p><b><a class=ath_autolink data-id=UPRf6NCJHU6zDrTf href=#>Keegan Murray</a>, SAC (100 ADP)</b> — Murray started 78 of 80 games for the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=92 href=#>Kings</a> in his rookie season, draining 41% of his looks from downtown. He was primarily used as a spot up player but that is not all he is. As The Athletic’s Sam Vecenie <a href=#>pointed out in a pod</a>, Murray was the guy in college and is comfortable getting his own shot and being aggressive. If Murray can utilize those skills with the Kings, he’s going to make this team that much more dangerous than it already is and open up the ceiling for his fantasy prospects. The Kings played at the 12th-fastest pace last season and there are offensive weapons galore. There will be plenty of opportunities for fantasy goodies.</p><p><b><a class=ath_autolink data-id=q6oHKUdJcW7PgLaq href=#>Scottie Barnes</a>, TOR (57 ADP)</b> — Barnes has garnered a usage rate in the 20% range. With <a class=ath_autolink data-id=DJq74red8aTFXbfg href=#>Fred VanVleet</a> gone, that number could increase. Barnes is already a good rebounder, disher of dimes and will rack up defensive stats. It’s the efficiency and ability to score from the outside which will unlock his ceiling. There’s a chance that Barnes puts it all together heading into his third season, especially since this could be “his” team if <a class=ath_autolink data-id=O4WMbrh2Eb51D9jq href=#>Pascal Siakam</a> gets moved.</p><p><b>John Collins, UTA (78 ADP)</b> — Player is not utilized properly and is sent packing to Utah. Where have we seen this story before? I have the utmost confidence that Will Hardy will put Collins in the best position to succeed. Whether he gets all the minutes at power forward remains to be seen, but if he does, then a replication of his 2019 season in which he averaged 21 points, 10 rebounds, 0.8 steals and 1.6 blocks is in the realm of possibilities.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><b><a class=ath_autolink data-id=fEErT6Ik9wCLDFY4 href=#>Tyus Jones</a>, WAS (81 ADP)</b> — We have seen what Tyus can do when filling in for <a class=ath_autolink data-id=O9seJiOia3fxGmjz href=#>Ja Morant</a>. Jones will be the starter for the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=63 href=#>Wizards</a> and should soak up as many minutes as he can handle.</p><p><b><a class=ath_autolink data-id=q5AikFj1T9qkrAq2 href=#>Daniel Gafford</a>, WAS (95 ADP)</b> — This situation reminds of Claxton’s from last season. The depth chart looks to be open for Gafford to shine and flourish. After never averaging more than 20 minutes a game, 28 to 30 seems like a viable outcome, especially since <a class=ath_autolink data-id=od8An2STcVLLYWOi href=#>Mike Muscala</a> is the primary backup at center. That said, head coach Wes Unseld didn’t unleash Gafford when <a class=ath_autolink data-id=iXclBS6oo11am7Ru href=#>Kristaps Porzingis</a> was out last season.</p><p><b>OTHERS</b> — <a class=ath_autolink data-id=OPoFPSs58KcCfehP href=#>Patrick Williams</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ZKR4PurwehHcDFw2 href=#>Grant Williams</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=33OEvvnRGShoQseF href=#>Bruce Brown</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=8CSIlPX4d6djMIv7 href=#>Obi Toppin</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=y2aAyhOICrxMcqUA href=#>Zach Collins</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=UJIWuy7eENyYipwc href=#>Keyonte George</a></p><p>(Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k3Jpb2pibXxzfJFsZmpoX2WBcLLAp6uaq6lir6K%2Fyp6rm5mcoXqjvsSaoqitpKh6c3yRbGRraGJpfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffantasy-basketball-breakouts-2023-2024.html&text=Fantasy%20basketball%20breakouts%3a%20Mark%20Williams%2c%20Keegan%20Murray%20and%20more&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffantasy-basketball-breakouts-2023-2024.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffantasy-basketball-breakouts-2023-2024.html&title=Fantasy%20basketball%20breakouts%3a%20Mark%20Williams%2c%20Keegan%20Murray%20and%20more" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffantasy-basketball-breakouts-2023-2024.html&title=Fantasy%20basketball%20breakouts%3a%20Mark%20Williams%2c%20Keegan%20Murray%20and%20more" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffantasy-basketball-breakouts-2023-2024.html&title=Fantasy%20basketball%20breakouts%3a%20Mark%20Williams%2c%20Keegan%20Murray%20and%20more" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffantasy-basketball-breakouts-2023-2024.html&description=Fantasy%20basketball%20breakouts%3a%20Mark%20Williams%2c%20Keegan%20Murray%20and%20more" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./julian-dunkerton-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Julian Dunkerton Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./barry-bonds-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Barry Bonds Net Worth  How Much is Bonds Worth?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
