Us too!</p><p>Harsh facial cleansers can appear on the beauty market with their pretty packaging and deceivingly irritating ingredients. It can be hard to look past the marketing spin, so that’s why we’ve compiled the ultimate list of the 15 best gentle face washes. This list is full of gentle face washes that have ingredients that soothe the skin at the same time as giving you an effective cleanse.</p><h3><strong>1. </strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Blu Atlas Volcanic Ash Face Cleanser</strong><span><br></span></a></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image12-41.png alt="Blu Atlas Volcanic Ash Face Cleanser" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>For a reliable cleanse that will keep you fresh without compromising, this Blu Atlas Volcanic Ash Face Cleanser is the cleanser you’ve been waiting for to answer all of your skin’s needs. The face wash is gentle enough to use morning and night with its lovely clean ingredients. Its content is free of all the nasties that can irritate your face. It’s preservative-free, paraben-free, synthetic dye-free, phthalate-free, cruelty-free, and vegan. Alongside all those fabulous things about this cleanser, the premium ingredients are from natural origins such as plants, fruits, and minerals.</p><p>Made to remove impurities and balance the pH level of your skin, this cleanser will knock your socks off with its softly exfoliating abilities, and the way it will give you a decent clean. It is made to suit various skin types with sensitive skin, oily skin, and dry skin being its forté. Try out one of their scrumptious face-wash scents including classic, and coconut apricot. It’s also available in a fragrance-free option.</p><p>The stars of this face wash’s cleaning performance are pomegranate seed oil, volcanic ash (also known as bentonite), and lactobacillus ferment filtrate. Pomegranate seed oil is full of anti-inflammatory powers to soothe irritation and redness. It’s high in antioxidants and anti-aging abilities because of its potency in protein, essential omega fatty acids, fiber, and Vitamins A, C, and K. Volcanic ash (bentonite) is full of high-absorbing particles that give the cleanser its power to remove excess oil from the skin, remove other impurities, make your pores feel tighter, and reduce the appearance of pores. Lastly, lactobacillus ferment filtrate is used for its potential to assist the health of the skin’s microbiome. This ingredient also helps fortify the skin’s ability to protect itself from everyday environmental aggressors.</p><p>The highly qualified dermatologists at Blue Atlas are so sure this face cleanser will be an excellent addition to your skincare routine, that they offer a money-back guarantee. If that doesn’t justify its top place on our list, we don’t know what would!</p><h3><strong>2. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kiehl’s Calendula Foaming Wash</a></strong><span><br></span></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image9-44.png alt="Kiehl’s Calendula Foaming Wash" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>You’ll get a hard-working face wash without any harsh ingredients when you choose Kiehl’s Calendula Foaming Wash. Gentle enough to be used anytime you need a cleanse, this wash will leave your skin feeling quenched and energized. The productive ingredients draw out impurities from the skin and the hydrating glycerin and calendula extract foams once activated with water. Soothing is this wash’s bread and butter with its ability to relieve the appearance of irritation while helping to balance the skin. For those with oily, sensitive, or normal skin types, this foamy wash will be an excellent face-washing companion. Kiehl’s formula is made without the use of silicones, sulfates, fragrances, dyes, oils, alcohols, and parabens.</p><p>Let’s take a look into some more of the ingredients that make this product a trustworthy face wash. Menthol, calendula extract, sodium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid, glycerin, and camphor. Menthol gives off that cooling sensation that settles the skin when applied (especially when the skin is red or itchy). Calendula extract is another soothing ingredient that has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries. It is a particularly great ingredient for oily skin to benefit from, as well as other skin types. Sodium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid draws moisture into the outer layer of the epidermis, and locks it in there thanks to its fantastic humectant properties. Glycerin is a compound that’s already found in the skin, so this extra boost of it helps to retain hydration and leave it feeling soft. Camphor is used to improve the skin’s appearance with its antifungal, skin-relieving, and antibacterial capabilities.</p><h3><strong>3. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Tatcha The Rice Polish Gentle</a></strong></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image3-45.png alt="Tatcha The Rice Polish Gentle" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Harbor, the power of licorice root extract and Japanese rice bran for your skin with this face wash which is like no other.

Scoop the creamy product out of the tub with the cute little spatula that comes with it, and get excited to wash your face with a cleanser that does things a little bit differently.</p><p>Hadasei-3 is Tatcha’s trademarked ingredient comprising three fermented superfoods: algae, rice, and green tea. This funky trio brings a healthy-looking improvement to the skin by restoring a natural glow. The combination of papaya enzymes and rice bran are finely ground up and used in this polish to encourage the skin to naturally rejuvenate itself which provides an even skin texture and a face that’s primed perfectly for makeup, or to go about your day as is.

Massage a small amount onto damp skin for 30 seconds before rinsing the product off with cool water and patting the face dry with a clean towel. If you opt for this cleanser, we recommend you try out Kate Somerville’s follow-up products to complete your skincare routine, DeliKate Recovery Cream Stressed Skin Relief and DeliKate Recovery Serum.</p><h3><strong>6. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Clinique Facial Soap Bar Mild</a></strong><span><br></span></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image7-47.png alt="Clinique Facial Soap Bar Mild" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The dermatologists at Clinique bring you their classic facial soap in a bar form, designed for delicate skin.

It is a wonderful face cleanser for anyone with sensitive skin, dry to very dry skin, and normal skin.

Canadian Willowherb soothes sensitive skin and removes any makeup remnants on the face and neck. The plant is sensitive skin’s best friend for its ability to soothe inflammation and kill off the bacteria that are responsible for some types of acne. Lactic acid removes dull-looking skin and replaces it with a glowing and smooth complexion. It can even out skin tone and texture while making it appear tighter. Through exfoliation, it tones down the visibility of dark spots, fine lines, and wrinkles. Exfoliation breaks up the bonds that hold dead skin cells together and removes them to give the skin a new radiating appearance.</p><h2><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2><h3><strong>What is the best gentle face wash?</strong></h3><p>There are many gentle face washes on the market but none quite like our favorite Blu Atlas face wash that rightly tops our list.
