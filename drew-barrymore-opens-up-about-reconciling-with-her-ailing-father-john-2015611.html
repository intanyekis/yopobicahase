"He got cancer," Barrymore shared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Friday. "And I had a very rare turn of events where I got to take care of him for three years in a hospice." (The actor passed away at age 72, in November 2004.)</p><p>According to Drew, her dad's burial was a cathartic moment for her and her siblings, <strong>John, Jessica</strong>, and<strong> Blyth.</strong> "We buried, well we put his ashes at Joshua Tree," she recalled. "He loved Joshua Tree and I had spent a lot of time with him there whenever I visited. If he had an address at all it was Joshua Tree. If you know Joshua Tree, there are no houses there. So we took his ashes there, and I went to this little motel."</p><p>In a rather spooky moment, Barrymore believed that she connected with her late father's spirit. "I was sleeping until we were all going to wake up and spread the ashes," she shared. "And I felt a thing and I sat up in my bed and the doorknob of my room opened and the door just opened. And I just sat up in bed and I was like, 'Dad?' It was a moment where you can have hope."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Nearly 10 years after her father's death, Barrymore reconciled with her mom in early 2014.</p><p>"She loves [my book]," the actress told DeGeneres on Friday. "I gave her a copy. We’ve talked about it very intimately and I have to say it was such an extraordinary year of my life writing this book. I came to terms with so many things. It’s a love letter to my daughters (<strong>Olive,</strong> 3, and<strong> Frankie</strong>, 18 months) and writing as a mother now myself and my daughters it was just, I found humor in places I didn’t have it before. I had a new perspective where it was different."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadqpWseqOt0auwpqeimnqwvMSnqmatoGKuo7vUrWSrnZOku6S1y6KloGWnnsGpeceeqWaZmaG2r7OMn5itoJWnequ7x6dka2hhaoNyfY4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdrew-barrymore-opens-up-about-reconciling-with-her-ailing-father-john-2015611.html&text=Drew%20Barrymore%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Reconciling%20With%20Her%20Ailing%20Father%20John&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdrew-barrymore-opens-up-about-reconciling-with-her-ailing-father-john-2015611.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdrew-barrymore-opens-up-about-reconciling-with-her-ailing-father-john-2015611.html&title=Drew%20Barrymore%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Reconciling%20With%20Her%20Ailing%20Father%20John" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdrew-barrymore-opens-up-about-reconciling-with-her-ailing-father-john-2015611.html&title=Drew%20Barrymore%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Reconciling%20With%20Her%20Ailing%20Father%20John" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdrew-barrymore-opens-up-about-reconciling-with-her-ailing-father-john-2015611.html&title=Drew%20Barrymore%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Reconciling%20With%20Her%20Ailing%20Father%20John" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdrew-barrymore-opens-up-about-reconciling-with-her-ailing-father-john-2015611.html&description=Drew%20Barrymore%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Reconciling%20With%20Her%20Ailing%20Father%20John" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./howie-long.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Howie Long Net worth, Age: Bio-Wiki, Weight, Kids, Wife">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./casey-affleck.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Casey Affleck News - Us Weekly">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
