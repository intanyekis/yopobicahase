The two had undeniable chemistry, and whoever got in their way was in for rough ride. That was the case for guest-star Lauren Tom, <a href=#>who actually got booed during tapings</a> for coming in the way of Ross and Rachel.</p><p>In the following, we're going to take a closer look at what the plans were like for a possible movie. Although fans seem to think that the cast nixed the plans, that wasn't the case. We'll reveal what Lisa Kudrown and <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a></strong> said about a possible film, and why it was rejected by those behind the scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-cast-of-friends-shared-their-thoughts-on-what-would-39-ve-happened-to-their-characters>The Cast Of Friends Shared Their Thoughts On What Would've Happened To Their Characters</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1.png><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The cast of Friends made some bold predictions</a> as to what the future might look like. According to Lisa Kudrow, Phoebe would be starting a family with Mike, and they would be doing things a little differently with their family.</p><p>“Phoebe’s married to Mike [Paul Rudd], they’re probably in Connecticut, they have kids, and I think she was the advocate for her kids who were a little different and all the other kids who were just a little different, creating the arts program, the music thing, all that.”</p><p>As for Rachel, she would also be living the family life alongside Ross. Aniston revealed, “You still played with bones,” she added. “That’s paleontology."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Matthew Perry Was Spot On With His Pep Talk For Aisha Tyler During Her First Day On Friends</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for the others, Monica would be just as intense and competitive, while her children would be overachievers.

Kudrow stated that the creators didn't want to re-up the stories, given how perfect the endings were on the show.</p><p>“That’s all up to [creators] Marta [Kauffman] and David [Crane], and I once heard them say — and I completely agree — that they ended the show very nicely, everyone’s lives are very nice, and they would have to unravel all those good things in order for there to be stories.

Although it wasn't the episode or film fans were hoping for, it was still great to go back in time and see how it all began and progressed throughout the ten years.</p><p>Some fans were hopeful that this sort of reunion can be an ongoing one every so often. However, Courteney Cox was quick to shut those rumors down, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claiming that it was a one time ordeal.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Honestly, this will really make me cry, but this will be the last time that we’re ever asked about the show as a group that we will do this," she said. "Like, we’re not going to do this [again] in 15 more years."</p><p>On the bright side, Cox revealed that the cast wouldn't wait as long to have dinner and enjoy time together away from the camera. Most of the cast remains very close and that should not come as a surprise given their great chemistry for many seasons.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoyapaKrpKS7bsPArGSoqJWjerW7jJpkn6qZmrulv4ympq%2BhlWKvtsCMrZ%2BeZaCnvKXBwp6prGWnpMKtsM2tZJqknKTEbrXTaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjennifer-aniston-was-open-to-a-friends-movie-but-the-producers-wouldnt-allow-it.html&text=Jennifer%20Aniston%20Was%20Open%20To%20A%20Friends%20Movie%20But%20Certain%20People%20Behind%20The%20Scenes%20Wouldn%27t%20Allow%20It&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjennifer-aniston-was-open-to-a-friends-movie-but-the-producers-wouldnt-allow-it.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjennifer-aniston-was-open-to-a-friends-movie-but-the-producers-wouldnt-allow-it.html&title=Jennifer%20Aniston%20Was%20Open%20To%20A%20Friends%20Movie%20But%20Certain%20People%20Behind%20The%20Scenes%20Wouldn%27t%20Allow%20It" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjennifer-aniston-was-open-to-a-friends-movie-but-the-producers-wouldnt-allow-it.html&title=Jennifer%20Aniston%20Was%20Open%20To%20A%20Friends%20Movie%20But%20Certain%20People%20Behind%20The%20Scenes%20Wouldn%27t%20Allow%20It" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjennifer-aniston-was-open-to-a-friends-movie-but-the-producers-wouldnt-allow-it.html&title=Jennifer%20Aniston%20Was%20Open%20To%20A%20Friends%20Movie%20But%20Certain%20People%20Behind%20The%20Scenes%20Wouldn%27t%20Allow%20It" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjennifer-aniston-was-open-to-a-friends-movie-but-the-producers-wouldnt-allow-it.html&description=Jennifer%20Aniston%20Was%20Open%20To%20A%20Friends%20Movie%20But%20Certain%20People%20Behind%20The%20Scenes%20Wouldn%27t%20Allow%20It" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./leonardo-baldwin.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Leonardo Baldwin- Third Born Child Of Alec Baldwin and His Second Wife, Hilaria Baldwin.">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./grammys-best-looks-history.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Iconic Grammy Awards Fashion Flashback History">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
