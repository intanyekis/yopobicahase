Furthermore, she is the second child and only daughter of Rocky Johnson. Wanda crossed the age of sixty as of 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/29/AA5RvvzH_400x400%20(1)-1672296954063.jpg><p>At the time of Bowles's birth, her father was just <i>eighteen</i>. Shockingly, Una Johnson, her mother, was only <i>thirteen</i>.</p><p>Wanda belongs to the&nbsp;<strong>Anoa'i&nbsp;family</strong>, an American Samoa professional wrestler's family. Her ancestral family includes WWE Hall of Famer&nbsp;<strong>Rikishi</strong>, <strong>Roman Reigns</strong>, and her half-brother Dwayne The Rock Johnson.</p><p>As of now, Rocky's daughter is currently in her sixties. Moreover, Wanda prefers to keep away from the limelight.</p><h2>Wanda Bowles Parent's Marital Life Ended Uncertainly: Know the Reason Behind It</h2><p>Wanda&nbsp;Bowles' parents,&nbsp;Rocky Johnson<strong> </strong>and&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Una Sparks Johnson</strong></a> tied the knot in <strong>1966</strong>. They first met at a dance while Bowle's father was pursuing to be a professional boxer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/8/18/Wanda%20Bowles%20was%20photographed%20with%20her%20parents%20and%20brother%20during%20her%20childhood-1692337827988.jpg><p>Una was from the Cherry Brook community and was devoted to Jehovah's Witnesses. The ex-couple had a great time together until they felt rifts in their relationship.</p><p>From the marriage, Sparks faced an obstacle regarding her husband's profession. Meantime, Johnson was pursuing his career as a wrestler, which her wife didn't seem to like. In addition, her religion forbade bloodsport.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/12/Rocky%20Johnson%20took%20a%20picture%20as%20he%20held%20his%20book%20at%20a%20meet%20and%20greet-1686552379512.jpg><p>The couple was convinced together for a long time but couldn't resolve it. Spark came up with a tough decision. She gave Johnson a choice, either his wrestling profession or her. It was one of the hardest choices for him.</p><p>Following the dream of a career, Johnson made a timid decision to stick with his work, which he had loved since childhood. Eventually, Rocky and Sparks said goodbye for the last time and divorced in 1978.&nbsp;</p><h2>How Many Siblings Does Wanda Bowles Have?</h2><p>The only daughter of Rocky Johnson, Wanda Bowles, has a giant family.

He was born on May 2, 1972, in Hayward, California, U.S. As of now, he is widely known by his ring name,&nbsp;<strong>The Rock</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Wanda Bowles Hasn't Contacted Her Other Five Siblings: But Why?</h2><p>Wanda Bowles has other five siblings who are not in contact with her, and the reason for being contactless with her five siblings was her father. Her father, Rocky, himself refused to contact them.&nbsp;</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=#>Sports Illustrated&nbsp;</a>magazine, the public recognized Wanda's father, Rocky, had five other children! Those kids were found through DNA testing.&nbsp;</p><p>Paula Parsons, Lisa Purves, Trevor Edwards, Aaron Fowler, and Adrian Bowles are Wanda's five other half-siblings. Although they are far from their spotlighted father, our sources have found some details about them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/12/Wanda%20Bowles%20with%20her%20father%20and%20brother-1686552797866.jpg><p>Wanda's fourth half-sibling&nbsp;<strong>Paula Parsons </strong>was born in 1964 to&nbsp;Thelma Parsons&nbsp;in Lucasville.

Her net worth & profession are out of the chart right now. She might have some assets to live a quality life, but she has not revealed it on any media.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/12/Wanda%20Bowles%20and%20her%20father,%20Rocky%20Johnson%20took%20a%20picture-1686552967175.jpg><p>Meanwhile, Wanda's father, Rocky, did have a <strong>staggering </strong>sum of money at the time of his demise in 2020. He amassed a whooping net worth of&nbsp;<strong>$280 million&nbsp;</strong>on his deathbed, which he accumulated from his successful wrestling career.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, Bowles' half-brother Dwayne Johnson has a net worth of a quarter billion,&nbsp;<strong>$800&nbsp;</strong>million similar to the net worth of Golf King&nbsp;<a href=#>Tiger Woods</a>. Moreover, he is also one of the highest-paid actors of all time.</p><h2>Unrevealed Truth: Speculation That Rocky Johnson Cheated Over Una Sparks</h2><p>Despite a mutually agreed divorce settlement between wrestler The Rock's father and his wife, Una, there is massive confusion.&nbsp;</p><p>Sources stated at the time of the pair's ongoing conjugal life, Rocky Johnson was romantically involved with another woman. He was dating&nbsp;<strong>Ata Fitisemanu Maivia</strong>, the daughter of a professional wrestler,&nbsp;Peter Maivia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/29/Cyej3XCW8AAxZTw%20(1)-1672297177260.jpg><p>According to the Maivia statement, Ata and Rocky first met at the wrestling hall. Peter and Rocky were a tag team. At that time, he became a father, but the newly born child's mother was not Una Sparks; that was Peter Maivia's daughter, Ata Fitisemanu Maivia.</p><p>The newborn child was&nbsp;Dwayne Johnson, born on May 2, 1972. Six years before the Una and Jhonson divorce. However, the new child's mother, Ata Maivia, disapproved of her relationship with Rocky.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, the claim she made was recognized as wrong. The mayhem over it hardly makes us think of two conclusions. Either Jhonson cheated on Una or separated at Rocky's third child delivery. The truth remained a mystery. Till now, people have yet to learn the truth behind it.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Stay Tuned With Us:&nbsp;</strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>Married Celeb</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jrCYp5yRYq%2Bww8ueqg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwanda-bowles.html&text=Wanda%20Bowles%3a%20Rocky%20Johnson%27s%20Daughter%20%26amp%3b%20Dwayne%20Johnson%27s%20Half-Sister&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwanda-bowles.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwanda-bowles.html&title=Wanda%20Bowles%3a%20Rocky%20Johnson%27s%20Daughter%20%26amp%3b%20Dwayne%20Johnson%27s%20Half-Sister" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwanda-bowles.html&title=Wanda%20Bowles%3a%20Rocky%20Johnson%27s%20Daughter%20%26amp%3b%20Dwayne%20Johnson%27s%20Half-Sister" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwanda-bowles.html&title=Wanda%20Bowles%3a%20Rocky%20Johnson%27s%20Daughter%20%26amp%3b%20Dwayne%20Johnson%27s%20Half-Sister" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwanda-bowles.html&description=Wanda%20Bowles%3a%20Rocky%20Johnson%27s%20Daughter%20%26amp%3b%20Dwayne%20Johnson%27s%20Half-Sister" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-ralph-cirella-from-howard-stern-show-wikipedia-age-and-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Ralph Cirella From Howard Stern Show?
