Miley Cyrus also chose to take risks to break away from her good-girl Disney ways. Other celebrities, like H.E.R., prefer to be more demure. With four Grammys and a&nbsp; lot of artists supporting H.E.R. over the years, it's clear that sometimes less is more. H.E.R. famously performs in sunshades and often dark clothing. In her earlier performances, she didn't show her face at all, but why? Let's examine why the "Focus" singer didn't always show her face and nine other facts about her.</p><h2 id=she-hid-her-face-to-let-her-music-speak-for-itself><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>She Hid Her Face To Let Her Music Speak For Itself</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some stars do not want to be a celebrity. They would prefer their talent to speak for themselves, and that is the way H.E.R. felt when she re-emerged in 2016. She didn't want anyone to question who she was dating or "focus" too much on her clothing. She did not want anything that involved superficiality associated with her identity. According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR</a>, she showed up on the cover of her debut E.P. "H.E.R. Volume 1" in a darkened silhouette because she felt as if that was "the era of the anti-star."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why The Olsen Twins Choose To Be Overly Private People</a></span></p><h2 id=h-e-r-stands-for-having-everything-revealed><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>H.E.R.

H.E.R. has always shared that her music is personal and covers how she has evolved as a woman. Besides reading this list, if you want to know a lot about H.E.R., the best thing that you can do is listen to her music because it pours out all of her emotions and shows who she genuinely is as a person.</p><h2 id=she-released-music-under-her-real-name><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>She Released Music Under Her Real Name</span></h2><p>At 14, H.E.R. had a record deal with Sony's RCA Records via J Records. The name of her debut single was "Something to Prove." which came out in 2014. H.E.R. According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Tribune</a>, H.E.R. has always considered her career a "slow build" and has never considered her so-called new identity as the shades-wearing mystery woman with the highly praised E.P.'s a "reset" or "re-brand." H.E.R.'s success did not come overnight, and she expressed that she takes time to release music, ensuring that each song is perfect in her eyes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-got-her-big-break-on-radio-disney-s-next-big-thing><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Got Her Big Break On Radio Disney's 'Next Big Thing'</span></h2><p>Before releasing her debut album, H.E.R. competed on Radio Disney's Next Big Thing at 12. Her song "My Music." got a feature on Radio Disney. This scenario isn't the only time H.E.R. was in the spotlight as a child. At nine, she also made her acting debut on the Nickelodeon TV film School Gyrls.</p><h2 id=people-compare-her-to-alicia-keys><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>People Compare Her to Alicia Keys</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When people hear H.E.R.'s music, they often compare her vocal stylings to that of Alicia Keys. She, like Keys, can also play the piano. In 2007, when she was ten years old, she performed a cover of Keys' "If I Aint Got You" on The Today Show. At the 2010 BET Awards, H.E.R. also performed another cover of Key's songs called "Fallin'." She considers Keys as one of her influences.</p><h2 id=she-plays-five-instruments><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She Plays Five Instruments</span></h2><p>When he was 10, her father, Kenny Wilson, worked as an ironworker for 17 years. Music was his hobby. He had a band and discovered that his daughter could sing along, and she became a child prodigy. She released a poetry book and learned how to play acoustic guitar, electric guitar, bass guitar, piano, and drums. In her 24 years of living, it's safe to say that H.E.R. has accomplished quite a lot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs You’d Never Know Can Play Instruments</a></span></p><h2 id=she-s-a-biracial-californian><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She's a Biracial Californian</span></h2><p>H.E.R. was born and grew up in Vallejo, California. Her father is Black, and her mother Agnes is Filipina. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">H.E.R. has opened up about struggles with her identity</a>, sometimes feeling "too Filipina" or "too Black." However, she learned to define her identity in a way that made sense to her. She discussed that her mother listened to many ballads, particularly Whitney Houston's music, and her father listened to a lot of Prince. Her parents lived in the same apartment complex, across the hall from each other, and her mother offered to cook food for her father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=many-stars-have-supported-h-e-r><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Many Stars Have Supported H.E.R.</span></h2><p>Through Twitter co-signs, shout outs, and re-posts, H.E.R.'s label mates Bryson Tiller and Keys were able to hip people to H.E.R.

H.E.R. has managed to garner so much buzz that it's easy to assume that her debut album has been out for years. She titled the album "Back Of My Mind" because that's the message in her music.
