They were declared legally single earlier in the year, but have continued to argue over the division of assets as well as custody of their four children.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What’s Going To Happen To Todd And Julie Chrisley’s Kids While They’re In Jail?</a></span></p><p>Here's everything we know about how Kanye’s financial situation has impacted his divorce.</p><h2 id=kanye-west-rsquo-s-recent-behavior-has-caused-financial-fallout>Kanye West’s Recent Behavior Has Caused Financial Fallout</h2><p>Kanye has been known for his controversial behavior for years, but his most recent antics have had a significant impact on his career. Following a series of anti-Black and antisemitic comments, numerous brands and companies began cutting ties with the rapper.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In October, <a href=#>Adidas, the Gap, and Footlocker all ended their relationships</a> with Kanye within a single day of each other.</p><p>“ <a href=#>Adidas does not tolerate antisemitism</a> and any other sort of hate speech,” Adidas said in a statement, weeks after it revealed its long-time partnership with Ye was under review.</p><p>They continued, “Ye’s recent comments and actions have been unacceptable, hateful and dangerous, and they violate the company’s values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness.”</p><p>Adidas has since revealed its plans to continue making Yeezy products, but without Kanye’s involvement. Footlocker and the Gap similarly announced they would no longer carry Yeezy products in their stores. Other brands like Balenciaga and Vogue also cut ties with Ye.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What’s Stopping Katy Perry And Orlando Bloom From Getting Married?</a></span></p><p>The end of these collaborations all represent a loss of income for Kanye, but none is as significant as losing Adidas. The partnership reportedly <a href=#>brought in between $1.5 billion to $2 billion</a> per year.</p><p>Shortly after Adidas pulled the plug, Forbes revealed that <a href=#>Kanye no longer qualifies as a billionaire</a> without the partnership. He went from a net worth of $1.5 billion to $400 million.</p><p>To add to his financial stress, Kanye is currently involved in a series of lawsuits, including a <a href=#>$250 million case filed by George Floyd’s family</a> after Ye made false remarks about his death. He’s also facing legal consequences amid allegations of toxic and discriminatory workplace behavior. Kanye has reportedly already <a href=#>paid employees undisclosed settlements</a> overs similar issues.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Similarly, Kanye’s manager is <a href=#>suing him for $4.5 million</a> after he claimed to be unjustly fired, despite a contract being in place.</p><p>Moreover, Kanye recently revealed in a podcast interview that the <a href=#>IRS has frozen four of his accounts valued at $75 million</a>, as he admits to owing $50 million in back taxes.</p><p>It appears Kanye has had to scale back his spending in the wake of his financial stress. In mid-November, it was reported he <a href=#>halted construction on his Malibu home</a> after being unable to keep up with the reno bills.</p><h2 id=kanye-west-wanted-a-huge-payout-from-his-and-kim-kardashian-s-divorce>Kanye West Wanted A Huge Payout From His And Kim Kardashian's Divorce</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kanye may have been banking on his divorce to help save his financial situation. According to one report, the rapper was <a href=#>hoping to get his prenup voided</a> and potentially receive a huge settlement from his ex-wife.</p><p>"She's very aware that he could be knocking on her day at any point, and the chances of him coming to the negotiating table for anything less than $1 billion are pretty slim. That's just how he rolls," a source told <a href=#>Radar Online</a> in early November.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Will Aaron Carter’s Family Challenge For His Inheritance?</a></span></p><h2 id=kanye-west-has-to-pay-kim-200-000-a-month-in-child-support>Kanye West Has To Pay Kim $200,000 A Month in Child Support</h2><p>Ultimately, it’s Kanye who’s going to have to pay Kim. The exes were set to go to trial next in December to settle the terms of their divorce, including custody and the division of their remaining assets. But they reached an agreement at the end of November, which a judge approved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ye agreed to <a href=#>pay his ex-wife $200,000 per month</a> in child support – $50,000 per each of their four children. They will also equally split the cost of their children’s’ security and education (including college in the future). Kim and Kanye agreed to joint custody, but neither will pay spousal support to the other.</p><p>Earlier reports suggested that <a href=#>Kanye was at risk of losing custody</a> after missing a scheduled deposition in mid-November.</p><p>“If Kanye refuses to show up to his deposition, the Judge could sanction him monetarily, make him pay counsel fees, and if it is an egregious enough discovery violation, the judge may be able to bar him from putting on a case at trial,” attorney Lexie Rigden of Rigden Law LLC told <a href=#>The Sun</a> .</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Coupled by Kanye’s recent behavior, there was speculation Kim could get full custody – Ye has already admitted she cares for them 80% of the time.</p><p>Nevertheless, with the terms of their divorce finalized, it appears Km and Kanye’s marriage is official over. But only time will tell if we can say same the same about Ye’s career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiioqVdoK6zsMCsn6KZnmK7psCMsKarrJhis7C4y6iuoqaXYrGqwtGomp5llqe8rnnKmqWynV2ssrTAjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkim-kardashian-net-worth-following-divroce-from-kanye-west.html&text=How%20Kanyes%20Financial%20Woes%20Are%20Impacting%20His%20Divorce%20With%20Kim&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkim-kardashian-net-worth-following-divroce-from-kanye-west.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkim-kardashian-net-worth-following-divroce-from-kanye-west.html&title=How%20Kanyes%20Financial%20Woes%20Are%20Impacting%20His%20Divorce%20With%20Kim" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkim-kardashian-net-worth-following-divroce-from-kanye-west.html&title=How%20Kanyes%20Financial%20Woes%20Are%20Impacting%20His%20Divorce%20With%20Kim" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkim-kardashian-net-worth-following-divroce-from-kanye-west.html&title=How%20Kanyes%20Financial%20Woes%20Are%20Impacting%20His%20Divorce%20With%20Kim" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkim-kardashian-net-worth-following-divroce-from-kanye-west.html&description=How%20Kanyes%20Financial%20Woes%20Are%20Impacting%20His%20Divorce%20With%20Kim" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./keith-gordon-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Keith Gordon Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-is-shootout-lyrics-tiktok-song-trend-meaning-and-original-music-by-elf-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is Shootout Lyrics Tiktok Song Trend?
