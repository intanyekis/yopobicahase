In 2005, he went on the USA tour performing in ‘Peter Pan’. Later, he started auditioning for roles but found it hard to land anything major.</p><p>At the age of 18, his family moved to Oregon when he found himself struggling to have a clear vision about his <a class=wpil_keyword_link title=future href=# data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>future</a>. He worked at ‘Urban Outfitters’ but did not get many acting opportunities.&nbsp; Hence, he moved to New York for seven months and failed to land any acting gigs but had a chance meeting with an actor, who had been booked on a TV show.</p><p>He was forced to return to Oregon to save some money and again moved to Los Angeles. This was a very harrowing time as he was sharing a three-bedroom apartment with five other people, traveling to auditions, and doing odd jobs to make ends meet.</p><p>Lately, his resilience and patience paid off in 2017 when he landed his first TV role in the popular crime drama ‘NCIS’. He made his on-screen TV debut in the episode ‘Pandora’s Box, Part 1’ where he played the role of Dezic’s son. He next appeared in the short ‘John John Goes Viral’ and in the same year, he also made his TV-movie debut in ‘Beverly Grove’.</p><p>In 2018, he made a critically acclaimed appearance as Pete in the episode ‘Un-Break My Heart’ of the sitcom ‘Grown-ish’. He played the recurring role in the series ‘My Dead Ex’ of Bryce.</p><p>In the same year, he made his official movie debut in the indie film ‘#WhenTodayEnds’. He went to audition for the role of Harvey Kinkle in Netflix’s reboot of the ‘Chilling Adventures of Sabrina’ but landed on the role of Nicholas Scratch as the role’s darkness appealed to him.</p><table width=604><tbody><tr><td>Girlfriends</td><td width=481>Not known</td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td width=481>Unmarried</td></tr><tr><td>Wife</td><td width=481>None</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Here we are providing you the list of Gavin Leatherwood’s favorite things.</p><table width=576><tbody readability=1.3285714285714><tr><td>Favorite Actors</td><td width=350><a class=wpil_keyword_link title="Will Smith" href=#>Will Smith</a></td></tr><tr><td>Favorite Actress</td><td width=350><a class=wpil_keyword_link title="Emma Stone" href=#>Emma Stone</a></td></tr><tr><td>Favorite Food</td><td width=350>North American Food.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Favorite Destinations</td><td width=350>Germany, Norway & Denmark.</td></tr><tr><td>Favorite Color(s)</td><td width=350>Black, Blue, White</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li>Gavin Leatherwood played the role of Matt in the short film ‘When We Were Young’.</li></ul><ul><li>His hobbies are photography and playing guitar.</li></ul><ul><li>He belongs to certain European Heritages such as Spanish, Irish, Greek, English, and Welsh.</li></ul><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLXKopmip16qwHCzwK%2Bgp2Wcmq61tMSrrqinlGQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgavin-leatherwood.html&text=Gavin%20Leatherwood%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Family%20%26amp%3b%20More&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgavin-leatherwood.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgavin-leatherwood.html&title=Gavin%20Leatherwood%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Family%20%26amp%3b%20More" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgavin-leatherwood.html&title=Gavin%20Leatherwood%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Family%20%26amp%3b%20More" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgavin-leatherwood.html&title=Gavin%20Leatherwood%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Family%20%26amp%3b%20More" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgavin-leatherwood.html&description=Gavin%20Leatherwood%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Family%20%26amp%3b%20More" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-close-are-new-girl-stars-jake-johnson-and-max-greenfield.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Close Are 'New Girl' Stars Jake Johnson And Max Greenfield?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./general-hospital.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Does Willow Die on General Hospital?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
