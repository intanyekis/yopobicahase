Yes, Chevalier is based on a true story.&nbsp;</p><p>The movie is inspired by the real-life events of Joseph Bologne, the trailblazer in Western classical music history. Since the protagonist was born in 1745, the movie holds the essence of the 18th century.</p><p>Joseph had a remarkable life, that only a few people get to experience. His unprecedented talent and genius mixed with romance, and tragedy accentuated by the music, has strongly developed the plot for a completely entertaining film.</p><p>Bologne is an athlete adroitly skilled in fencing, playing violin, and composing music. One thing that stood as a hindrance in life is his skin color and identity as a 'Black' man.</p><p>Many filmmakers have made movies for iconic historical figures from Bologne's time period including Amadeus Mozart, who was deeply inspired by Bologne. But finally, after years, Ed Guiney, Stephen Williams, and Stefani Robinson have attempted to bring the encouraging tale of Bologne to the big screen.</p><h2 id=movie-actors>Movie Actors</h2><p>Cast of Chevalier 2023 includes Kelvin Harrison Jr, Samara Weaving, and Minnie Driver in the key roles. Mezi Atwoodm and Jim High are the supporting characters.</p><h3>Kelvin Harrison Jr Plays Joseph Bologne Chevalier De Saint-Georges</h3><p>French man Joseph Bologne, the star of the film is portrayed by the American actor Kelvin Harrison Jr. Kelvin gave his all to bring the character of Joseph to life.&nbsp;</p><p>Because his dad teaches classical music to university students, it was beneficial for Harrison to learn more about the craft that he was going to portray onscreen.&nbsp;</p><p>To master the art of playing violin, he was trained by his father for 5 hours a day. The dedicated actor sustained injuries while shooting, which included a fracture of his clavicle.</p><p>Growing up in a musical family, Kelvin was deeply honored to be able to perform this role. And when he got the part, he gave a brilliant performance.&nbsp;</p><p>The 28-year-old actor has spent almost a decade in Hollywood, and is known for his films like 'Luce Edgar', 'Monsters and Men', and 'Waves'. He is a 2020 BAFTA-nominated actor who also bagged a SAG award in 2021.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/posts/9d0d049d-574b-4d79-a186-47fc159889fe/the-stars-of-the-movie-at-toronto-international-film-festival-2022.webp></p><h3>Samara Weaving as Marie-Josephine de Montalembert</h3><p>Like most of her co-stars, even Samara Weaving had little knowledge of Bologne and all of his outstanding accomplishments. Marie-Josephine de Montalembert is one of the high-profile love interests of Joseph.</p><p>While Samara was busy shooting for the 2021 mini-drama series 'Nine Perfect Strangers', she was approached by the team of this film. One of the reasons she signed for it is because she wanted to depict the role of a singer.</p><p>It was a strenuous job to play a real opera singer, but she pulled it off incredibly. Moreover, her chemistry with Kevin is great.</p><p>Born on 23 February 1992, the Australian actress started gaining recognition in the U.S. around 2017. Weaving has tied her hands in writing and directing as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of her best works are 'Ready or Not' where she essayed the role of Grace, and 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' with an 8.1 IMDB rating where she played Penelope.</p><h3>Lucy Boynton as Marie Antoinette&nbsp;</h3><p>Lucy Boynton acted the challenging part of Marie Antoinette, the famous Queen of France. As there is extensive information about Antoinette, Boynton had a hard time choosing how should she depict the role.</p><p>The Queen was impressed by the unmatched skills of Bologne, resulting in close ties between the two. Also, Bologne used to teach music to Antoinette. Despite the difficulties, Boynton has done justice to her character.</p><p>The British American actress started her journey in the film industry as a child star who developed a knack for acting at 10.</p><p>Throughout her long career, she has been part of movies like 'Bohemian Rhapsody', 'Let Me Go', 'The Pale Blue Eye', and 'Miss Potter'. Lucy has appeared in TV shows like 'Sense & Sensibility', 'Law & Order', 'Gypsy', and many others.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/posts/9d0d049d-574b-4d79-a186-47fc159889fe/samara-weaving.webp></p><h3>Minnie Driver as Marie-Madeleine Guimard</h3><p>Marie-Madeleine Guimard was the well-celebrated ballerina of the Paris Opéra, who was infatuated with all-rounder Bologne.&nbsp;</p><p>Minnie Driver gracefully played Guimard who is hurt when Joseph did not reciprocate her feelings. She was one of the members who joined the team at last.</p><p>The London-born entertainer studied at Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art and has been actively pursuing acting since 1991.&nbsp;</p><p>Driver garnered immense fame for the portrayal of Skylar, Matt Damon's love interest in the superhit 1997 movie 'Good Will Hunting'. Also, she has starred in the television series 'Speechless', 'The Riches' and ' The Witcher: Blood Origin'.</p><p>The Academy Awards-nominated artist has four more projects in the pipeline as mentioned in <a href=# rel=noopener>IMDB</a>.</p><h3>Additional Cast Members in the movie are:</h3><ul style=list-style-type:square><li>Mezi Atwoodm as Dorothy</li><li>Alec Newman as Poncet</li><li>Jessica Boone as La Arnould</li><li>Jim High as George Bologne</li><li>Ben Bradshaw as La Bossiere</li><li>Marton Csokas as Montalembert</li><li>Sian Clifford as Madame de Genlis</li></ul><h2 id=where-to-watch-chevalier->Where To Watch Chevalier 2023?</h2><p>You can watch Chevalier in your nearby movie theaters from Friday, April 21, 2023.

The film was scheduled to come out on the 7th of April previously.&nbsp;</p><p>In September 2022, it premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and gained good reviews.&nbsp;</p><p>The biographical film was supposed to be released on 7 April 2023 but got delayed by two weeks.</p><h2 id=review>Review</h2><p>Chevalier movie review is all positive as it got a 92% rating on <a href=# rel=noopener>Rotten Tomatoes</a>. In The Guardian's experience, it is declared as 'fascinating but flawed' with 3 stars.</p><p>The historical film centers around the astounding life of Bologne, who happened to be born as an illegitimate child of his father Georges de Bologne Saint-Georges. Although Georges came from a noble French family, his son Joseph was birthed by an African slave, which made all the difference.</p><p>Fortunately, Bologne was a gifted child. Whatever he learned, he excelled, and only a few people could give him competition.&nbsp;</p>Official Trailer of the movie released by Searchlight Pictures ( Source : <a class=imagesource href=#>youtube</a> )<p>He grew up in Paris, the capital of France rich in culture and art. There, he learned sword fighting and violin, and in a short time, Joseph was renowned as the greatest swordsman and expert violinist in&nbsp;Europe.&nbsp;</p><p>If Bologne had not inherited African roots, his life might be easier as a prodigy. But due to his race, he had to miss many opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>Racism is deeply rooted even now, and it was rampant when Bologne was born. Kelvin has done a phenomenal job playing the character of Bologne who had to deal with many challenges due to his identity.</p><p>All three women named Marie contributed to shaping his life's trajectory. Apart from that, the political upheaval of that time has been shown in the biopic because Joseph was a part of the Revolutionary Army.</p><p>As often told by the movie crew, it truly is the 'untold story' of an intellectual man. The cinematography and sound of the film are engaging and alluring, with the power to take the viewers back to the 18th century.</p><p>It has been receiving mixed reviews with some critics emphasizing the underwhelming performance of the actors and a few finding defects in the storytelling.</p><p>Anybody enthusiastic about that century's French history and lifestyle who wants motivation can enjoy this 107-minute movie.</p><p><strong>You May Like:</strong></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Where To Watch Grid Down Power Up Documentary?
