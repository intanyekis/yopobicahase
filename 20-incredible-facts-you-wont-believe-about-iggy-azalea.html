If she were not so famous, we might think: what? An iguana? A flower? What is this?</p><p>This is a female rapper-singer from Australia who has taken the world by storm. From humble beginnings to a fiercely impressive musical career, she epitomizes the ultimate Cinderella story. Although she has always been hot. And a wild child. Okay, so maybe she was not exactly Cinderella, but her story is one for the history books.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So what is it about Iggy Azalea that makes her so intriguing? Well, for one, she is not afraid to tell it like it is or state her opinion. She is not frightened by the shock factor either, and with songs like “Pu$$y,” this 25-year-old star has cemented herself as an edgy yet excellent musician.</p><p>As a female rapper, Iggy has an image of being rough-and-tumble, yet also in control of her situation. She is a strong female and will never back down. If you think you know a thing or two about this chick, then we invite you to read our list of 20 Incredible Facts You Won’t Believe About Iggy Azalea.</p><p>From her seemingly-bizarre name to the ink of her (totally blush-worthy) body, here are some tidbits that may surprise you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=20-she-s-named-after-her-dog><strong>20. She’s named after her dog</strong></h2><p>Yep, Iggy Azalea is a…dog! The singer was born Amethyst Amelia Kelly, but changed her pop culture persona to Iggy Azalea, a name she got from her pooch. Iggy was her cute little doggy when she was just a kid, and the story behind this canine is a bit scary. Apparently the dog was always getting into scrappy fights and getting bloodied up. Why not name yourself after a dog with violent tendencies?! Perfect! The singer will tell you that she was inspired by the dog’s perseverance and his ability to always come back from a struggle. Aw, how bloody adorable!</p><p></p><h2 id=19-she-was-a-model><strong>19. She was a model</strong></h2><p>Yeah, it is definitely no secret that Iggy Azalea is hot hot hot. As it turns out, she has always been attractive, and was even a model. Now that she can pose and sing, she is showing up on countless magazine covers in full glossy glory. We have seen Iggy in all kinds of clothing, or lack thereof, and we can only expect to see these gorgeous photos continuing. Hey, when you are tall, blonde, and have a killer bod, why not show that off? Add in some zesty lyrics and you are the one-of-a-kind Iggy Azalea! Swoon, swoon, swoon!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=18-she-loves-those-classy-women><strong>18. She loves those classy women</strong></h2><p>Think <a href=#>Grace Kelly</a> and <a href=#>Victoria Beckham</a> and…Fran from The Nanny sitcom. If you are a fan of Iggy Azalea’s fashion sense, then you can thank the likes of <a href=#>Gwen Stefani</a> and Scary Spice. Yes, Iggy has said that she admires the classier females of pop culture past, but the daring and sometimes overly-sharing clothing of Hollywood’s rebels really speak to her. So Iggy’s inspiration for style and fashion is a bit eclectic, but it definitely results in something quite magnificent. Apparently the singer loved donning animal print since she was just a little girl. She was like a little leopard cub!</p><p></p><h2 id=17-she-has-a-beef-with-miley-cyrus><strong>17. She has a beef with Miley Cyrus</strong></h2><p>This is a beef over the famous twerk. You guessed it: <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> was fronting! She did not start that dance-floor craze; it was Iggy Azalea! Iggy has said that yeah, while Miley can get down and dirty on the stage, it was she – Iggy – who had started that whole thing. Iggy has been twerking her perky rear end long before Miley. It sounds as though Iggy is not too happy that Miley stole her thunder. Most of us associate twerking with the wild child, but Iggy clearly states that NO! It was her! Imitation is the best form of flattery, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=16-she-is-such-a-hopeless-romantic><strong>16. She is such a hopeless romantic</strong></h2><p>Have you ever noticed Iggy Azalea’s tattoo on the fingers of her left hand? They say A$AP Rocky, and they are from her lovey-dovey (not-so-much) relationship. Yeah, Iggy is just a big lover. She wanted to commemorate that adoring love with some ink, so she did. And when things did not work out as planned? Well, Iggy owned it and as a strong independent female would do, she simply got more ink to “x” out the name A$AP Rocky. Badass and totally not noticeable! No hard feelings though. Iggy admits that yeah, she loved him, and she is not ashamed of it. Girl power!</p><p></p><h2 id=15-she-likes-to-eat-a-lot><strong>15. She likes to eat…a lot</strong></h2><p>Iggy Azalea may have an awesomely fit body, but she must work out super-hard to maintain it. It turns out that the singer loves herself some food. And who would blame her? When you are rich, famous, and young, there is practically every opportunity to hit up a party or awards ceremony. And that means free food! Iggy has been known to get to receptions and parties and head to the food table like it is no one’s business. We can certainly admire a girl who likes to eat. There is something love-hate about it. Dang, she is so hot…and she eats like a dude!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=14-she-is-really-tall><strong>14. She is really tall!</strong></h2><p>No, really. Iggy Azalea towers above the crowd at 5 feet, 10 inches. And that is without the heels, my friends. Once she straps on those sky-high stilettos, there is nothing stopping this chick. No wonder the singer has a song called "Black Widow"; she could be a huge scare if she dressed all in black and attacked us from above. But we digress. With a size 10 shoe (or a bit bigger, since Hollywood runs pint-size), Iggy Azalea can rock just about any kind of platform, sandal, heel, or sneaker. We would escort her to a Foot Locker any day!</p><p></p><h2 id=13-she-is-a-spotlight-stealer><strong>13. She is a spotlight stealer</strong></h2><p>A quick Google search should pull up some fun and amusing pictures of the Australian singer-rapper. Iggy Azalea loves to snatch the spotlight away from her peers. I mean, the girl came over to the United States at age 16 to totally steal the show. And so she did. And she does not even have to sing or rap or twerk her body for us to snag our attention. Iggy is a great photobomber, and there must be something so utterly satisfying about taking the limelight off of a fellow musician or singer and letting it all shine on you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=12-she-likes-strange-date-nights><strong>12. She likes strange date nights</strong></h2><p>Such as going to…Target. Because who does not love Tar-jay? What a wonderful way to show that you are a low-maintenance chick. All you need is the dollar bin and maybe a stop at the food court to share a personal pan Pizza Hut pizza. Nothing says “I love you” more than that, right? Maybe other girls should take a hint from Iggy Azalea. Our next date may very well be at a popular everything store. Apparently Iggy went to Target for her first date with Nick Young, also known as hot young NBA basketball player for the LA Lakers. Slam dunk!</p><p></p><h2 id=11-she-is-not-touchy-feely-with-fans><strong>11. She is not touchy-feely (with fans)</strong></h2><p>At least not with perverted audience members who attend her concerts. It appears that Iggy Azalea used to be known for her epic jumps into the audience, who would then help her “surf” through the crowd. Totally epic indeed. Until people try to touch and grope and stick their fingers where they should not be going! Iggy had to just say “no” to crowdsurfing, so unfortunately, we can only hope that some of her awesomeness will fling from her to us peons in the audience. Reportedly Iggy was experiencing these touchy-feely issues with more females than males, which is completely okay if you are into that kind of thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=10-she-is-impulsive><strong>10. She is impulsive</strong></h2><p>Naturally. As anyone named Iggy Azalea (after a dog) would be. It is said that she got her very first tat after seeing some works of wisdom written in graffiti on a wall somewhere. You know, we go into bathroom stalls and subway stations all the time and see little pearls of wisdom. Maybe we will take a chance and tattoo the first thing we see on ourselves. Oh, it said “go f*&# yourself”? Well…maybe not. If only we were all so lucky as Iggy Azalea. She sees awesomeness on the wall and an hour later she gets inked up to radiate the positivity.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-she-is-a-high-school-dropout><strong>9. She is a high school dropout</strong></h2><p>But are not all of the totally amazing celebs out there high school dropouts? Iggy Azalea ditched high school in Australia and jetted over to the United States at the tender age of 16. The rest is history, as we can see. Iggy does not need a diploma to tell her she is awesome. She only needs to look at her album sales, sold-out concerts, and YouTube views to see that she is ruling the pop culture scene. Screw those academics. Iggy is clearly too cool for school. The next time we feel like ignoring that big exam or skipping that work deadline, we are looking to you, Iggy!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-she-was-however-valedictorian-of-xxl><strong>8. She was, however, Valedictorian of XXL!</strong></h2><p>Yes, Iggy Azalea made it to the Top 10 Freshman list for XXL. Woot woot! This was yet another slap in the face to traditional education. Iggy Azalea broke out onto the scene, and the crowds loved her. This Aussie rapper definitely has the vocals and looks to take her to infinity and beyond. No piece of paper is needed to tell her just how incredible she is. If we needed any further evidence that Iggy Azalea has what it takes to dominate the pop culture world, here it is! Make it to the top of an esteemed list of other awesome people? Check!</p><p></p><h2 id=7-she-works-hard-to-get-that-body><strong>7. She works hard to get that body</strong></h2><p>Sure, Iggy Azalea is naturally gorgeous beyond gorgeous, but she works hard to maintain that physique! Which is important considering that the girl likes to nom on cake and other delicious treats. It may make us less jealous that she is always looking so fit and fab in her music videos and onstage. Those squats, crunches, and cardio workouts are definitely working overtime, girl! Sign us up for whatever fitness class you are enrolled in, because those results are incredible. Fitness inspiration? Iggy Azalea. Fashion inspiration? Iggy Azalea. Now excuse us while we go do jumping jacks and push-ups while listing to “Work”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-she-has-a-clothing-section-dedicated-to-her><strong>6. She has a clothing section dedicated to her</strong></h2><p>Just check out Revolve Clothing’s Iggy Azalea section for all things fabulous. In the summer of 2014, Iggy became a fresh new face for the clothing line. Gasp! Maybe if we wear these clothes we will look just like Iggy! Save your paychecks, my friends, because there is a whole lot of awesomeness to buy. Iggy looks hot and beautiful in the Revolve Clothing catalogue, putting her modeling skills to the test. She can rock a sweat suit or a little black dress like it is her professional job. Oh wait, it was for a time. Well, she can definitely pull off a variety of looks, and she can add “totally-awesome fashion endorser” to her resume.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-she-faked-her-age><strong>5. She&nbsp;Faked her Age</strong></h2><p>It turns out that Iggy Azalea was a bit of a criminal! She got a fake ID when she was just 13 years old. Apparently she looked pretty mature and skipped the whole awkward-puberty bit. She would grab her fake identity, hit the bars, get smashed, and do it all over again the next weekend. It looks as though that real-life experience really paid off once she flew off to the United States and started her modeling and rapping career. She really does know what she is talking about when she sings about the party lifestyle!</p><p></p><h2 id=4-she-was-born-wild-and-crazy><strong>4. She was born wild and crazy</strong></h2><p>Not only did Iggy Azalea hit the bottle bright and early in her life, but she was exposed to a lot of adult activities when she was just a girl. That probably explains a lot now, doesn’t it? As it turns out, Iggy would walk her pre-teenage self to strips clubs, bars, and the red light district downtown and meet older men. She was banging and grinding before most kids her age even knew what that was! She clearly was not afraid to get friendly with strangers, and would hitchhike to the nighttime hotspots for some fun and games. And we thought we were cool for playing Seven Minutes in Heaven…</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-she-is-a-mean-lean-cleaning-machine><strong>3. She is a mean, lean, cleaning machine</strong></h2><p>So it turns out that Iggy Azalea comes from a rather humble family. Her dad was the artsy type and her mom made a living by cleaning other people’s homes. When the family was trying to make ends meet, Iggy would help her mom out with the housecleaning duties. This helped the family save money and it really did pay off! At just age 16, Iggy was able to fly to the United States and now she is a multi-million dollar singer-rapper. It just goes to show you: dreams can come true. If your hot and blonde and have an awesome Australian accent.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-she-owes-her-career-to-some-bahamian-guy><strong>2. She owes her career to some Bahamian guy</strong></h2><p>No, really, hear us out on this one. Iggy got to the United States when she was really young. How was she to know anyone, after coming from a country on the other side of the world; in another freaking hemisphere? She landed in Miami and knew just one person: a dude from the Bahamas who was living in Florida. So, he picked her up once she landed (who cares about catfishing and child molesters?!) and the rest is history. This guy had some experience in rapping and music, and he was part of the reason why we have Iggy Azalea today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-she-is-from-nowhereville><strong>1. She is from Nowhereville</strong></h2><p>And when we say Nowhereville, we mean Mullumbimby. With a population of just 3,000 people, it was a wonder that Iggy Azalea even knew what hip-hop was. She grew up in this ho-hum little town and somehow managed to learn about hip-hop and the industry. She loved the outrageousness of it all: the clothing, the lyrics, the attitude. Oh yes, the attitude. Before she knew it, she was ditching old little Mullumbimby and heading to the grand ol’ U.S. of A. Who knew a little Australian chick could become one of the United States’ favorite female rappers?
