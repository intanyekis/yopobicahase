They met in 2000 at a mutual friends’ party and hit it off so well they started dating soon after. Howard has had tremendous success over the years and despite being<a href=#> rumoured to be a secret billionaire</a>, he has a net worth of $650 million. His wife Beth on the other hand has seemingly gained more success since marrying Howard. Before marrying Howard Beth had a net worth of $1.5 million, and she now has a net worth of $50 Million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Howard Stern Is Struggling With His Mother's Health In 2022</a></span></p><h2 id=about-howard-stern-rsquo-s-wife-beth-ostrosky>About Howard Stern’s Wife Beth Ostrosky</h2><p>Beth Ostrosky was an actress and received her first role in the 1996 film Flirting with Disaster as one of the daughters of Ben Stiller's supposed birth parents. She later went on to have a more prominent role in the film Whipped. Beth made for television debut in the final season of the G4 show Filter, and shortly after that went on to the Spike TV series Casino Cinema.</p><p>Beth has also been in a handful of modeling jobs including her own line of calendars. She has also been on the cover of the For Him Magazine three times. Beth has been voted for by readers of the For Him Magazine as one of 100 Sexiest Women of the Year. She won this honor in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2007. She has been 96th on the list for Most Desirable Woman in 2007 for AskMen.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is What Howard Stern's Youngest Daughter Is Doing Now</a></span></p><p>When she is not acting or modeling, Beth takes the time to write in her free time, primarily focusing on her love of animals. In 2010, she wrote her book "Oh My Dog: How to Choose, Train, Groom, Nurture, Feed, and Care for Your New Best Friend", reaching #5 on The New York Times Best Seller list. In 2014, Beth wrote her first children's book "Yoda: The Story of a Cat and his Kittens" and released its sequel book the following year titled "Yoda Gets a Buddy".</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Howard Stern Is Partially Responsible For Sarah Hyland's Career</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To take her love of animals to the next level, Beth decided to maintain dedicated foster rooms at her house for cats and kittens in need of permanent homes. She began this project in 2013 and followed it up by launching an Instagram account to gain more exposure for the animals for her care. For Beth, 2019 is a very memorable year considering that is when her account gained more than half a million followers. However, followers were not very happy with Beth's Instagram back in 2021 and think <a href=#>Howard Stern had changed her Instagram account</a>. Not only did Beth get more followers she also managed to get roughly 1,000 of the animals in her care adopted. Beth Stern is truly an admirable human being and has done a wonderful as an animal rights activist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=howard-stern-and-beth-ostrosky-rsquo-s-happily-ever-after>Howard Stern and Beth Ostrosky’s Happily Ever After</h2><p>After nearly a year of being engaged, Howard Stern and Beth Ostrosky finally had their time to walk down the aisle. The wedding was surely one to remember with a celebrity-filled guest list that includes the Trump family, Jimmy Kimmel and, his then-girlfriend, Sarah Silverman, Chevy Chase, Joan Rivers, and Barbara Walters.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Are The Most Unlikable Howard Stern Show Staffers</a></span></p><p>The ceremony was officiated by none other than Mark Consuelos and Billy Joel was there to perform two beautiful songs at the ceremony. Everyone in attendance at Howard and Beth’s wedding did not realize it was happening that night because they kept it a secret. Guests thought they were invited to an engagment party but soon found out it was the real deal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=howard-stern-and-beth-ostrosky-rsquo-s-are-stilling-going-strong>Howard Stern And Beth Ostrosky’s Are Stilling Going Strong</h2><p>It has been now 13 years since Howard Stern and Beth Ostrosky first said their “I do's” to one another, and they’re commitment to each other has remained stronger than ever. Howard and Beth have also gone so far as renewing their vows on The <a href=#>Ellen DeGenere</a>s Show in 2019 to prove their love to one another. Howard told Ellen that he would love to remarry his wife any and every day because he is just that happy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2017, the couple began working closely with the Wildlife Rescue Center of the Hamptons and the North Shore Animal League. Both Howard and Beth feel that helping animals find the homes and care they need is not only beneficial for the animals but to them as well because it always does feel good helping those who need it. Howard mentioned in an interview that “It’s just very fulfilling, it brings you outside yourself, you’re helping an animal and that bond, it sounds cliché, but that bond is really fantastic, and it makes me feel so good that we can help. Beth is so competent and so masterful with the animals coming through our home that it takes my breath away.” Another reason their relationship is going on still is because they are not afraid to be honest with each other. Beth Ostrosky was not hesitant to reveal to her husband when <a href=#>she was furious with how Howard Stern was treating his staff members</a>. It just proves that honesty is the best policy in any relationship and only makes it stronger.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Howard Stern Said Terrible Things About Ellen DeGeneres Before Becoming Her Friend</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK%2BRp7Fuv9Oeqadlp56zpnnBnquhZZ9iu6bAjLCmq6yYZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhoward-stern-wife-beth-o-net-worth.html&text=How%20Much%20Was%20Beth%20Ostrosky%20Worth%20Before%20Marrying%20Howard%20Stern&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhoward-stern-wife-beth-o-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhoward-stern-wife-beth-o-net-worth.html&title=How%20Much%20Was%20Beth%20Ostrosky%20Worth%20Before%20Marrying%20Howard%20Stern" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhoward-stern-wife-beth-o-net-worth.html&title=How%20Much%20Was%20Beth%20Ostrosky%20Worth%20Before%20Marrying%20Howard%20Stern" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhoward-stern-wife-beth-o-net-worth.html&title=How%20Much%20Was%20Beth%20Ostrosky%20Worth%20Before%20Marrying%20Howard%20Stern" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhoward-stern-wife-beth-o-net-worth.html&description=How%20Much%20Was%20Beth%20Ostrosky%20Worth%20Before%20Marrying%20Howard%20Stern" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./khloe-kardashian-chloe-grace-moretz-feud-over-kimye-taylor-swift-w429573.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Khloe Kardashian, Chloe Grace Moretz Feud Over Kimye, Taylor Swift">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hgtvs-hilary-farr-bids-farewell-to-love-it-or-list-it-after-12-years.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="HGTVs Hilary Farr Bids Farewell to Love It or List It After 12 Years">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
