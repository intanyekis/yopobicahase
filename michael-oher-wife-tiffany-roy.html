Tiffany Roy first became the resident of Michael’s heart seventeen years ago, and since then, she has held her place firmly.&nbsp;</p><p>In November 2022, Tiffany Roy and retired professional footballer Michael Oher tied the knot at the JW Marriott in Nashville, Tennessee.&nbsp;</p><p>Their long-term union had been unknown to the public until <a href=#>news</a> of their nuptials went viral online.&nbsp;</p><p>Prior to their marriage, Oher had been in the headlines in 2017 following an altercation with an Uber driver, which resulted in a misdemeanor assault charge that was ultimately dropped.</p><p>The couple had been together for 17 years before getting engaged in July 2021 and exchanging vows on Nov. 5, 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>They reportedly met while attending the University of Mississippi, although details of how they met remain unknown. They have four children together: Kierstin, Naivi, Kobi, and MJ.</p><p>Tiffany Roy is the director of Feminish Collection, an online clothing store, and describes herself as a “wife and mother” on the website.&nbsp;</p><p>She is also the vice president of Oher’s nonprofit organization, Beat The Odds Inc., which aims to help disadvantaged individuals thrive. The couple has been involved in assisting needy families through the organization since 2016.</p><p>Michael Oher had a successful career in the <a href=#>NFL</a>, playing for the Baltimore Ravens and winning the <a href=#>Super Bowl</a> in 2013.&nbsp;</p><p>He later played for the Tennessee Titans and Carolina Panthers before retiring from football in 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>Oher’s story has been the subject of several retellings, including the 2009 film “The Blind Side,” which focuses on his life as a homeless youth before being adopted by Leigh Anne Tuohy and her family.</p><p>Although the movie “The Blind Side” was a commercial success, grossing over $300 million and receiving several accolades, it has faced criticisms for its accuracy.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, the book provides a more comprehensive view of Michael Oher’s life as a child, including all individuals who played a significant role in his success. In contrast, the movie focuses primarily on Tuohys’ contribution.</p><p>Despite Oher’s past legal troubles, the couple has been committed to helping disadvantaged individuals through their nonprofit organization, Beat The Odds Inc.</p><p>The Blind Side, a movie that grossed $300 million and received a Best Picture nomination, follows the inspiring story of Michael Oher, a young boy born into a broken <a href=#>family</a> with 12 siblings and no proper home.&nbsp;</p><p>Oher’s life takes a turn for the better when he meets the Tuohy family, who eventually adopt him and encourage him to pursue football.&nbsp;</p><p>Oher’s football skills eventually earned him a scholarship to play for the University of Mississippi’s Ole Miss Rebels.</p><p>He later becomes a successful NFL offensive tackle for the Baltimore Ravens, Tennessee Titans, and Carolina Panthers.</p><p>After retiring from football in 2017, Oher has dedicated himself to philanthropy, working with foundations such as the Tuohy family’s “Making it Happen,” his own Oher Foundation, Beat The Odds Inc, and the Good Deeds app.&nbsp;</p><p>Oher’s success story, both on and off the field, serves as an inspiration to many, and his dedication to giving back to the <a href=#>community</a> is a testament to his character.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Tiffany Roy?&nbsp;</h2><p>Michael Oher’s wife, Tiffany Michelle Roy, is a Lansing, Michigan, resident who attended the University of Mississippi and met Michael Oher there.&nbsp;</p><p>She is the owner of the Feminish Collection online <a href=#>fashion</a> store and reportedly co-heads the Oher Foundation with Michael.&nbsp;</p><p>Tiffany Roy and Michael Oher have four children: Kobi, MJ, Kierstin, and Naivi.&nbsp;</p><p>However, as she keeps her private life low-key, little is known about Tiffany’s personal life, such as her age, net worth, and family details. Moreover, she is not active on any social media platforms.</p><p>The wedding of Tiffany Roy and Michael Oher was exclusively covered by People’s magazine.&nbsp;</p><p>The heavenly-themed event was held at Nashville’s luxurious JW Marriott hotel, and over 200 guests attended the occasion.&nbsp;</p><p>The ballroom was decorated with blue and white accents, feathers, glass, crystals, and eight-foot-tall floral arrangements.</p><p>Guests were entertained with a choreographed dance by ballerinas, a musical band, and a cocktail hour.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC5yJyfmp2cYrypsdFmrqKelWLBqrLFmqWyZaKkxnA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmichael-oher-wife-tiffany-roy.html&text=Michael%20Oher%20Wife%20%20Who%20Captivated%20The%20NFL%20Players%20Heart%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmichael-oher-wife-tiffany-roy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-oher-wife-tiffany-roy.html&title=Michael%20Oher%20Wife%20%20Who%20Captivated%20The%20NFL%20Players%20Heart%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmichael-oher-wife-tiffany-roy.html&title=Michael%20Oher%20Wife%20%20Who%20Captivated%20The%20NFL%20Players%20Heart%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-oher-wife-tiffany-roy.html&title=Michael%20Oher%20Wife%20%20Who%20Captivated%20The%20NFL%20Players%20Heart%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmichael-oher-wife-tiffany-roy.html&description=Michael%20Oher%20Wife%20%20Who%20Captivated%20The%20NFL%20Players%20Heart%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1424882-report-update-on-drew-mcintyres-contract-talks-with-wwe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Report: Update On Drew McIntyres Contract Talks With WWE">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./justin-herbert-wiki.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Justin Herbert Height, Age, Girlfriend, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
