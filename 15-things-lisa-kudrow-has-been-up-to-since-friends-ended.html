These talented actors made the characters from the scripts so easy to love. These actors and their characters became household names for generations to come.</p><p>Lisa Kudrow is known for her Emmy-winning role as Phoebe Buffay on the popular sitcom,&nbsp;Friends.&nbsp;For 10 seasons,&nbsp;Kudrow played the unique and quirky masseuse and self-taught musician. Despite her&nbsp;long-time connection to the character, Kudrow&nbsp;has managed to move past her association with her iconic role. She maintains a successful career in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at Lisa Kudrow! Here's&nbsp;15 Things Lisa Kudrow Has Been Up To Since Friends Ended!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2005-the-comeback><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>2005: The Comeback</span></h2><p>Soon after the series finale of Friends, Kudrow produced, directed (some of the episodes, anyway), wrote and starred in the HBO series,&nbsp;The Comeback. Keeping it close to home, she played a sitcom actress by the name of Valerie Cherish.</p><p>After failing to find work for a period of time, Cherish lands&nbsp;a role on a new network sitcom. She agrees to have her return to television filmed for a reality series entitled,&nbsp;The Comeback.</p><p>Although the series was canceled after its first season, HBO brought the series back for a second season nine years later, in 2014.</p><p>Kudrow is a sitcom actress, but an employment dry spell doesn't seem to be an issue for her.</p><h2 id=2005-happy-endings><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>2005: Happy Endings</span></h2><p>In this ensemble-based&nbsp;dramedy, Kudrow plays Mamie Toll, a mother who teams up with a filmmaker to find her son. She had put him up for adoption. The film also stars Tom Arnold, Laura Dern, Jason Ritter, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.</p><p>When it comes to creating&nbsp;a winning ensemble, Kudrow is always a good addition.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2007-p-s-i-love-you><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>2007: P.S. I Love You</span></h2><p>In the novel-turned-film, Kudrow plays Denise, a friend of a widowed protagonist by the name of Holly (portrayed&nbsp;by Hilary Swank). Kudrow's character supports Holly as she begins a journey of healing. Holly loses her husband and then finds 10 messages that he left her.</p><p>The film was a box office hit, grossing $156 million. Even as a friend in a film, she is bringing in the big bucks.</p><h2 id=2008-web-therapy><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>2008: Web Therapy</span></h2><p>This initially improvised Web series became such a hit that Showtime adapted it for broadcast on their network. Over the course of four seasons, the Emmy-nominated show featured a ton of guest stars, including Academy Award Winner, Meryl Streep, and former Friends cast members, Courteney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer. After four seasons, the series was canceled.</p><h2 id=2009-hotel-for-dogs><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>2009: Hotel For Dogs</span></h2><p>Nickelodeon Movies adapted this children's novel by Lois Duncan into a film for DreamWorks Pictures. Kudrow, alongside Kevin Dillon, uses her comedy chops to portray a careless foster parent to two kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Leave it to Kudrow to make being a bad parent funny.</p><h2 id=2010-easy-a><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>2010: Easy A</span></h2><p>In this teen comedy film starring Emma Stone, Kudrow plays Mrs. Griffith, a high school guidance counselor who makes questionable decisions. Her portrayal boosted the humor quotient of this critic's favorite.</p><p>Whether it's a therapist or high school guidance counselor, Kudrow knows how to bring the laughs.</p><h2 id=2010-who-do-you-think-you-are><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>2010: Who Do You Think You Are?</span></h2><p>Kudrow is one of the executive producers of the American version of this British genealogy documentary series, where celebrities trace parts of their family trees. The UK version aired on the BBC network in 2004. In 2010, the American version aired on NBC.</p><p>The show remained on NBC for three seasons before it was canceled. Fortunately for the star, it was picked up by TLC, where it aired for an additional seven seasons.</p><p>In the first season, Kudrow discovered that her great-grandmother was murdered&nbsp;during the Holocaust.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2010-cougar-town><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>2010: Cougar Town</span></h2><p>Kudrow has guest-starred on numerous television shows, including friend and former co-star&nbsp;Courteney Cox's sitcom,&nbsp;Cougar Town. In her role, Kudrow gives her long-time friend a hard time, while playing a mean dermatologist.</p><p>These friends can't stay away from each other. Web Therapy, Cougar Town...where else will these two collaborate?!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is How Courteney Cox Envisions The 'Friends' Reunion</a></span></p><h2 id=2013-scandal><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>2013: Scandal</span></h2><p>Comedy isn't the only thing on her resume. The Friends star made a guest appearance in a story arc on the widely successful ABC drama,&nbsp;Scandal, starring Kerry Washington. She played an impactful role as Congresswoman and presidential candidate, Josie Marcus.</p><p>In one of her episodes, she delivered one of Shonda Rhimes' infamous monologues - this one was about sexism (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">via Huff Post</a>).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2014-neighbors><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>2014: Neighbors</span></h2><p>Back into the world of comedy! Kudrow steps into an educational role&nbsp;again as a college dean, Carol Gladstone, in the film starring Seth Rogen and Zac Efron. She made another appearance in the 2016 sequel, Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising. &nbsp;</p><p>If anything is to be learned, we know that Kudrow is superb in advisor roles.</p><h2 id=2014-bojack-horseman><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>2014: BoJack Horseman</span></h2><p>Making her debut in the second season of the animated series, the comedic actress made quite the impression as Wanda Pierce, a female owl and BoJack's one-time girlfriend. She went on to become a regular character.</p><p>On top of acting, writing, directing, and producing, she also has voice acting on her resume. What hasn't she done?</p><h2 id=2016-angie-tribeca><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>2016: Angie Tribeca</span></h2><p>What's a comedy series without Kudrow guest-starring? Rashida Jones starred as a police detective, Angie Tribeca, in this comedy series. Kudrow makes an appearance in the pilot, in a very peculiar role.</p><p>It can be quirky or dramatic - this&nbsp;beloved actress will take on the role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2016-unbreakable-kimmy-schmidt><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>2016: Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt</span></h2><p>The critically acclaimed Netflix original series, created by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock, was a success on many levels. When star character, Kimmy Schmidt, played by Ellie Kemper, is freed from a doomsday cult after 15 years, she's left alone to figure out the real world. In season two, we finally meet her absentee mother...and who else than Kudrow could nail this role?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends Reunion Is Really Happening, HBO Max Confirms</a></span></p><h2 id=2016-the-girl-on-the-train><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>2016: The Girl On The Train</span></h2><p>The Emmy-winning actress showed off her acting chops as a co-star in this mystery-thriller, alongside Emily Blunt. In this film adaptation of the best-selling novel of the same name, we get to see (yet again) why Kudrow is the big star we know and love today.</p><h2 id=2017-the-boss-baby><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>&nbsp;2017: The Boss Baby</span></h2><p>Of course, it takes a boss like multitalented Lisa Kudrow to voice the mother of&nbsp;The Boss Baby. The film grossed $528 million and a sequel is slated to release in 2021. The massive success of the film prompted the Netflix series, The&nbsp;Boss Baby: Back in Business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lisa Kudrow does it all!
