Though the Friends star is arguably more beloved than the financially troubled former reality star, Pratt made headlines when he publicly criticized Lisa Kudrow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's not the first time Spencer Pratt has voiced his opinion on another celebrity, though last time it was one of his former co-stars that he drew into the spotlight. Pratt tweeted that Lauren Conrad, who had previously fallen out with Spencer and his wife, should be "Kylie Jenner rich," which <a href=#>some people interpreted as a dig of some sort on Conrad</a>.</p><p>Whatever his intentions, that situation was less cut-and-dried than the derogatory mention he made of Lisa Kudrow. Yet his comment has fans wondering what Kudrow is really like when she's not on screen.</p><h2 id=spencer-pratt-called-lisa-kudrow-the-quot-rudest-celeb-quot>Spencer Pratt Called Lisa Kudrow The "Rudest Celeb"</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It might seem strange that Spencer would ever meet Lisa in person, but it turns out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they ran into one another in 2009 at an "elite A-list party,"</a> according to OK Magazine.</p><p>Considering that Spencer and his wife Heidi Montag have been ostracized from Hollywood after <a href=#>going broke and falling off the A-list</a>, it's unlikely Spencer knows Lisa personally, or that they ever kept in touch.</p><p>Yet Lisa reportedly had a specific piece of advice for Heidi Montag, and Spencer didn't like it.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Here’s Why Heidi Montag Almost Divorced Spencer Pratt">Here’s Why Heidi Montag Almost Divorced Spencer Pratt</a></span></p><p>In a video posted to TikTok, Spencer claimed that Lisa (whom he called Phoebe Buffay) approached Spencer and Heidi and told the latter that she needed to "get away" from her husband.</p><p>Pratt claimed that Kudrow said he had "the eyes of a serial killer."</p><h2 id=spencer-pratt-39-s-tiktok-audience-had-mixed-reactions-to-his-story>Spencer Pratt's TikTok Audience Had Mixed Reactions To His Story</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Spencer continued to relay the story, saying he and Heidi initially thought that Lisa was joking, or that they had been invited to the party to be trolled.</p><p>But after an awkward pause, they realized she must have been serious; Pratt relates that Kudrow "just walks away."</p><p>Commenters reacted with mostly laughing emojis, suggesting that Kudrow's comments were funny, not creepy, and that Pratt was making too much of nothing.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Here's Why Lisa Kudrow Is The Smartest 'Friends' Cast Member">Here's Why Lisa Kudrow Is The Smartest 'Friends' Cast Member</a></span></p><p>Some commenters said they were shocked, while one highly-rated response suggested that it was Phoebe's twin, Ursula, that Spencer met.</p><p>One fan piped up that "Lisa Kudrow is an icon," and the fact that Bethenny Frankel came "tooting in" had them rooting for Lisa.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some commenters did agree that Lisa seemed a bit off-putting in person, and plenty of people did take Spencer's side, with one person saying they didn't realize how "toxic" people from The Hills were, and noting that Spencer and Heidi were 'beginning to be' their favorite.</p><h2 id=is-lisa-kudrow-really-rude-in-person>Is Lisa Kudrow Really Rude In Person?</h2><p>Though Spencer Pratt's story may be true, it doesn't seem that all of his followers buy that Lisa was actually serious about what she purportedly said.</p><p>Plus, given that Spencer and Heidi haven't always been Hollywood's favorite couple, fans could be correct in guessing that Spencer either made up or embellished the story for attention.</p><p>Either way, though she hasn't been publicly effusive about <a href=#>her relationship with her former castmates from Friends</a>, people close to Lisa seem to think she's great.</p><p>Many commenters who may or may not be fans of Spencer's thought that the interaction he described was funny and on-brand for Kudrow, not offensive or rude.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Lisa Kudrow Had The Most Phoebe Buffay Response To Courteney Cox’s Surprise For Her">Lisa Kudrow Had The Most Phoebe Buffay Response To Courteney Cox’s Surprise For Her</a></span></p><p>However, recent Hollywood hot take personality Bethenny Frankel commented on Spencer Pratt's TikTok with a comment of her own. Frankel stated that she had a "crazy experience also," when Lisa Kudrow came on her talk show.</p><p>When fans clamored for details, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Frankel posted a TikTok explaining what she meant</a>.</p><p>The 2012 interview was recapped in 2022 as Bethenny described her experience with Lisa, after saying she enjoyed talking to Spencer on her show because he was "honest" about fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of Lisa, Bethenny stated that the Friends star acted as if she didn't want to be there, though she's sure Lisa is 'a lovely person,' but that the interview was awkward.</p><p>Frankel elaborated that Kudrow acted like the interview wasn't planned, and like Bethenny was approaching her at the grocery store rather than participating in a mutually agreed-upon interview.</p><p>While Lisa doesn't seem to have responded to the drama Spencer started, fans on her Instagram seem to be supporting her, with one person summing up by noting, "Not going to take the word of a D rated thirst trap" when it comes to judging Kudrow's personality.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecuiqpplm6qxs7vWZqOio5Vitq95z56prKeeYsCxsc2cnKtloKeutcCO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-lisa-kudrow-like-in-person-spencer-pratt.html&text=Spencer%20Pratt%20Says%20Lisa%20Kudrow%20Is%20Rude%3b%20What%20Is%20She%20Really%20Like%20In%20Person%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-lisa-kudrow-like-in-person-spencer-pratt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-lisa-kudrow-like-in-person-spencer-pratt.html&title=Spencer%20Pratt%20Says%20Lisa%20Kudrow%20Is%20Rude%3b%20What%20Is%20She%20Really%20Like%20In%20Person%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-is-lisa-kudrow-like-in-person-spencer-pratt.html&title=Spencer%20Pratt%20Says%20Lisa%20Kudrow%20Is%20Rude%3b%20What%20Is%20She%20Really%20Like%20In%20Person%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-lisa-kudrow-like-in-person-spencer-pratt.html&title=Spencer%20Pratt%20Says%20Lisa%20Kudrow%20Is%20Rude%3b%20What%20Is%20She%20Really%20Like%20In%20Person%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-lisa-kudrow-like-in-person-spencer-pratt.html&description=Spencer%20Pratt%20Says%20Lisa%20Kudrow%20Is%20Rude%3b%20What%20Is%20She%20Really%20Like%20In%20Person%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./stephanie-kurtzuba-biography-age-family-husband-net-worth-law-and-order-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stephanie Kurtzuba Biography, Age, Family, Husband, Net Worth, Law And Order">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./171041-heres-what-scream-queen-dee-wallace-look-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here's What Iconic Horror Films' 'Scream Queen' Dee Wallace Looks like Nowadays">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
