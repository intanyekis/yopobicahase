Together they have around 690,827,691 views, and that's going up every single time someone listens to one of their songs on YouTube alone! You can easily come across a bunch of online debates about who is better and why. Both stars have been friends and worked with each other before, they even had their own Disney shows! However, there's always a few reasons why fans prefer Demi Lovato over Selena Gomez.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, this is not to say Selena isn't a A-Lister who is deserving in her own right, but there are often many reasons as to why some stars do better in the spotlight than others. Demi Lovato has known a very rocky road, and that its not something that is easily overcome, but she has managed to really hold herself up high in Hollywood. She has an incredible voice, is not a terrible actress, and is constantly trying to help where she can. Those are only some of the reasons why the entire world is in love with her!</p><h2 id=they-have-different-ways-of-getting-a-message-out-there>They have different ways of getting a message out there</h2><p>While Selena manages to do this quite well, <a href=#>Demi Lovato</a> can quickly and easily make you relate to the song's emotional value. This is especially done by lyrics which can on their own make or break a song. Demi has in some cases written her own songs. This means that everything that she was feeling and thinking at that time came out in the form of lyrics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She then sang those lyrics and all of that emotion was displayed in her song which really makes the listener connect. Even the content of the songs is different. She has been able to talk about her experiences via the recording studio. When all of that is mixed in with the beat, it creates that thought in the mind that everything is going to be okay. It's actually quite a good thing.</p><h2 id=demi-lovato-is-caring>&nbsp;Demi Lovato&nbsp;is caring</h2><p>It's not so obvious at first glance but if you took a gander for a moment you'd see it. She cares about a lot of things. It even seems as if she cares about more than the average Joe, she comes across as a deeply caring person.</p><p>Somewhat like that mother who would notice when even the slightest sniffle came upon her child. It's not easy achieving the look of a&nbsp;someone that truly cares, but Demi Lovato really does look like the kind of person that would care for everyone. She likely even cares about her fans and their families.&nbsp;From the moment you look at her, you get that sense from her posture, walk, and way of talking.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-has-a-dog-named-batman>She has a dog named Batman</h2><p>Let's be real, if you practically grew up on Batman and superheroes in general, you would be in love with her dog, which would then make you want to listen to her music. A dog named Batman not only makes her know that she's quirky and fun but also makes fans feel like they're her friend.</p><p>The act of having your dog named something is awesome, it's truly fascinating that someone would do that, most individuals wouldn't dare do it because of "social norms" and all that stuff. Demi is different, she isn't afraid to name her dog something that would make superhero fans from all over the world fanboy/girl or it for years to come. (Source: <a href=#>TeenVogue</a>)</p><h2 id=her-fans-find-it-very-easy-to-relate-to-her>her fans find it very easy to relate to her</h2><p>Sometimes people get a little low, and they do things that they would rather not, but their mind can't differentiate. It's a coping mechanism that is used to deal with emotional, physical and psychological damage and that's only the tip of the iceberg.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once someone starts doing it, it's a hard hole to pull yourself out of, even with help. Demi Lovato is someone who managed to overcome the difficult challenge. Her fans can see this and use her as an example of how to try and improve their unfortunate situation. Having someone that&nbsp;has been through such things to look to for indirect advice and encouragement can be a huge help on the road to recovery. (Source: <a href=#>Mirror</a>)</p><h2 id=she-uses-her-fame-to-promote-mental-health-awareness>she uses her fame to promote mental health awareness</h2><p>Many people with mental illnesses end up being bullied, discriminated, or worse. Sometimes these things happen because of a lack of knowledge and a general fear of people who aren't happy all the time.</p><p>Demi is someone who advocates for mental health awareness, as it is important to inform people on how to identify, help and not be&nbsp;mean towards people who are suffering. Demi Lovato uses the tools at her disposal to help with the messages of mental health. People feel good about themselves when they see someone who they listen to on the radio saying that it's okay to have a mental illness. She does a lot of good by helping out by using her fame to inform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=you-can-relate-to-demi-s-side-of-the-strange-friendship>&nbsp;You can relate to Demi's side of the strange friendship</h2><p>In one case of her friendship with<a href=#> Selena Gomez</a>, it seemed as if the two stopped hanging out for a little while. Both parties likely felt&nbsp;that they were no longer connecting with one another, and naturally fans tend to take sides. It is no surprise that a lot of fans backed Demi.</p><p>Whether it be by listening to her music, watching her TV shows, or being an open talker of the good things she's done, people tend to support Demi. It's easier for someone to connect when they already know about the problems that person has had, especially if they're going through the same thing. Many people feel left out of their social groups at one point or another. Demi and Selena probably felt that when it seemed like they stopped talking for a while.</p><h2 id=she-s-different-in-every-good-way>she's different in every good way</h2><p>Demi Lovato isn't just your ordinary pop star. She is genuinely different, she does things for herself for her own personal enjoyment. The reason Selena and her have been friends for so long is part of her ability to be herself without fear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She embraces adversity and understands that she's not the average person walking down the street but rather someone who has been through a lot. Demi has those underlying quirky values that just make her more interesting. It's hard to come by in current times and when someone is like that, fans lose their minds because they've been deprived of it for so long. Lovato has that ability to be herself without regret, and it shows in a good way.</p><h2 id=she-s-creative>&nbsp;She's creative</h2><p>Many of us find it difficult to reference instances indirectly but still manage to get the idea of what we just said by. It's kind of like when you want to be just a little bit passive aggressive and everyone understands it right away.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Demi has even made some friendly referencing on her relationship with Selena. She made an Instagram post where she wrote: "Kill em with kindness.... or choke em with a smile on your face. ðŸ˜‡" This was a nod to one of Selena's songs. The fans of Demi knew right away what the reference was. It's kind of like an art when it happens. Having that talent to do that effectively is something that will make people who often read or write go crazy for the star.</p><h2 id=she-inspires-those-who-need-it-most>&nbsp;She inspires those who need it most</h2><p>When someone is unfortunately at the bottom of the barrel and is about to give up, Demi's songs of hope and joy can lift them up. It's even a better tool that they can use to try and dig their way out of a trench of unhappy relationships and endings.</p><p>Demi Lovato has gone through a bunch of these situations and quite honestly she has likely already helped so many people out with the lyrics of her songs. Having lyrics that are emotionally charged and are from the heart can help people. People who need inspiration can turn to her music to write, sing, gain comfortability, and get advice. It's pure inspiration as if her songs are like a fountain that doesn't run out of the water, ever when it comes to getting inspired to get stuff done.

This is completely different from most people who find themselves just having one or two different histories within their family heritage, however, to have four is simply a level beyond most individuals.</p><p>To think this is all by chance just brings out the wow in everyone. Let's face it, if you know someone who's from somewhere and you're from that same exact location, you would also listen to them because you feel connected to them. This is what some people feel with Demi.</p><h2 id=demi-s-mother-is-a-former-dallas-cowboys-cheerleader>Demi's mother is a former Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader</h2><p>Demi's mother, Dianna Hart used to be a Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader. It's something many of us wish we had. Having a family member that was a cheerleader for such a popular sports team is pretty awesome, and can help you gain popularity with the sports lovers of the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's not just that, apparently the cheerleaders have also been some very hard working people who've tired themselves to ensure that they can be a patch of motivation for the players and fans. It simply helps set up your child for greatness when some of the stories told to them are of how much hard work was put into simply being a cheerleader, and that's not including anything else she was doing at that particular time. (Source: <a href=#>People</a>)</p><h2 id=demi-lovato-has-worked-hard-to-get-where-she-is>Demi Lovato has worked hard to get where she is</h2><p>Not every star has been so lucky as to get whatever they want from everyone, especially mommy and daddy. People like the idea that someone is at least somewhat self-made and mostly had just support. It shows people that hard work can achieve greatness if&nbsp;they&nbsp;just manage to keep trying and persevere in the face of adversity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If things were truly handed to her on a silver platter, she would be less caring of the people around her, however as we have mentioned before she's got that mother look to her. Demi Lovato is someone who's always working towards getting to be the best in her field of work, she's never just given up on everything. This is why people like her, she's their beacon of hope for when they need to know that you can't buy your way to true happiness and success. (Source: <a href=#>GlobalCitizen</a>)</p><h2 id=she-manages-to-create-a-sense-of-want>She manages to create a sense of want</h2><p>People are always interested in learning more about each other. They never want to stop, unless they lose interest for whatever reason it may be, in this particular case, they never lose interest in her because of her ability to one keep creating quality content that people like. She also enjoys new looks. This can be clothing, hairstyles, and more. When people have a constant flow of strong connections between music and their emotions as well as the creator's emotions, they tend to get engaged more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's a call to action but not exactly that. People want to learn more about someone who they find comfort in, its kind of like when your pet helps you through a hard time, you end up learning more about them because you feel that they've added you. Caring is one of her specialties and her songs have helped many people want to learn more about her and her many experiences both good and bad. (Source: <a href=#>CBSNews</a>)</p><h2 id=the-lyrics-to-her-songs-are-amazing>The lyrics to her songs are amazing</h2><p>Lyrics are pretty important to a song in modern times. We rely on them to give us the meaning of the song, adapt them to our own lives and create remixes that are pretty catchy. Demi Lovato is not shy of amazing when it comes to looking into her lyrics. It's not hard to realize that her lyrics are good. They must be catchy and absolutely need to flow with the beat of the song. When you listen to a song by Demi Lovato, the lyrics are taken to another level.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They put you into a mental trance by ensuring that you're both given a mental picture of what's going on behind the scenes of the song and enable you to understand where the writer is coming from. It's quite a difficult thing to achieve. However, when you sit down and analyze them it takes some actual brain power to fully comprehend the how deep the lyrics can take someone who's just listening at home.&nbsp;(Source: <a href=#>Grammy</a>)</p><h2 id=she-is-always-expanding>she is always expanding</h2><p>If anyone's determined to expand it's her. She's kept herself going through being a Disney child star, which has a whack ton of stress associated with it. Her talent is that she's not going to give in to what the haters want.</p><p>They want to see her on the ground crying that something didn't go her way in life, but they'll never see it because Demi comes off as a little bit of a planner. She seems like someone who doesn't just sit around and wait for stuff to happen. She's a proactive individual, and it shows, she takes charge and doesn't shy away from a challenge of a lifetime if need be. (Source: <a href=#>Grammy</a>)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-willing-to-be-emotional>She's willing to be emotional</h2><p>Anyone can be emotional on a television series, video and on a stage. However, to openly talk about your struggles to your fans is unique. When she declared that she's had a history of self-harm to the world, it was more than just a huge milestone in her life, it was her showing that she's in a better place now. It was pure emotions. No one can just pretend like it wasn't.</p><p>This isn't the only time either, she became emotional onstage when she was celebrating the wonderful six years of sobriety she had accomplished. Only people who're acting real in a situation actually cry, it shows that they're in connection with themselves at that moment in time. (Source: <a href=#>Billboard</a>)</p><h2 id=she-gives-deep-meaning-to-everything-she-does>she gives deep meaning to everything she does</h2><p>When first listening to one of her songs you'll notice that you can find so many meanings to her songs. This usually depends on the lyrics and video that can go alongside a song. It's easier with a video because you'll have a visual representation, but the lyrics offer you so much potential to take the meaning in many different directions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is the deeper meaning of her doing everything, crying on stage could be her way of celebrating with someone watching her show who's also been sober for six years. It's not superficial by any length and is actually quite useful for many people. It's awesome that she does this. She is providing people an outlet. (Source: <a href=#>Billboard</a>)</p><h2 id=she-has-stay-strong-tattooed-on-her-wrists>She has "Stay Strong" tattooed on her wrists</h2><p>It's a popular idea, for someone to tattoo something on their body that helps them. In Demi Lovato's case, she's got Stay Strong tattooed on her wrists. This seems to be a reminder of sorts when she needs it most, that she can and has stayed strong before, so she'll be able to do it again.</p><p>We know Demi has been through a lot of hard stuff and she helps a lot of people, just the knowledge of her getting that tattoo is enough for them to look forward to perhaps getting one themselves. Young individuals often get tattoos that mean something to them personally. Demi is not short of this, she's gotten several tattoos that are signs of self-help and tools of encouragement for herself. It's clear that she's someone who knows how to try and help herself out. (Source: MTV)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-style-is-amazing>her style is amazing</h2><p>Her hair is just fabulous, she's been able to change it over and over again and look amazing from any angle, filter, camera and with any style. She knows how to rock pretty much anything that comes her way in the form of fashion. It's as if in a past life she was a fashion designer that was world renowned and these skills carried over so she'll dress so well.</p><p>She's gone from&nbsp;looking like a&nbsp;small-town girl to big city popular girl. It's certainly something that only a few people can get done right and she's one of those individuals that can do it. Having style is important in every aspect of life, it makes you look more appealing, in both a business sense and a personal way. Demi has style, she has all of that. What's even better is that she dresses to make herself comfortable, and not the people around her. Demi Lovato has a talent for dressing to impress, and inspires others to do the same.

Everything from the beat to the melody can make someone prefer one artist over another. It's just people having an opinion, it's completely normal for it to happen as well.</p><p>In some cases, Demi has a talent that's hard to match, especially in the lyrical writing area.
