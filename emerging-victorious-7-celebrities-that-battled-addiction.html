It's tricky as well, even though it seems glamorous and shiny. Celebrities react to problems in a different way, and sometimes, they are rolling into the abyss. It's not a secret that being a celebrity is hard. Famous people have <a href=#>constantly been in the public eye</a>. Any failure, be it divorce, bad habit, or strange outfit, can raise outrage, which might be hard to accept. So, <a href=#>dealing with problems</a> using bad habits can cost a lot, but some celebrities overcame it and managed to sort out their mess. Here are some of the stories:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ben-affleck>Ben Affleck</h2><p>Despite being a Hollywood star, Affleck had tough times in his life, which led to a <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">divorce from Jennifer Garner</a>. It started when he was filming in the 'Justice League' movie and went on and on. "If you knew how many actors and directors and writers were alcoholics or compulsive in some way — I mean, it's the most ordinary thing in the world in Hollywood," he said in <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter's 'Awards Chatter; podcast</a>. Well, Hollywood is not an easy place to survive in. Nevertheless, he admitted his problem and started working on it. Even though he's not married anymore, he takes care of his three children, and for now, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he started dating Jennifer Lopez again.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=demi-lovato>Demi Lovato</h2><p>A famous pop singer and a Disney star jumped at the bait of the celebrity lifestyle. But addiction never comes without reason. It started when they were 17; at that time, Lovato were working for the Disney Channel. "I was scared, because my mom always told me your heart could just burst if you do it, but I did it anyway. And I loved it," they said in their 2017 YouTube documentary, Simply Complicated. Yet, they've been in rehab several times and still continue struggling. "Getting sober was difficult," they said to Glamour in 2016, "I went into rehab, I came out, and I didn't stay sober. I still had issues occasionally. Now some days it's difficult; some days it's easy." This May, Lovato <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">declared themselves non-binary</a>. "I feel that this best represents the fluidity I feel in my gender expression and allows me to feel most authentic and true to the person I both know I am, and am still discovering," they said. For now, Lovato tries their best to live a sober life. For example, they've been invited to cook Paris Hilton's pink glitter cannolis in the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cooking With Paris reality show.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Demi Lovato: The Ways She Spends & Earns Her Fortune</a></span></p><h2 id=gary-oldman>Gary Oldman</h2><p>Oldman is a very talented actor who's been sober for 25 years. However, he admitted that he romanticized having an addiction due to the roles he had. "All my heroes were drinkers or opium addicts, and you get all misty-eyed about these poets and playwrights and actors who were big drinkers," he said. The final point of the bad habit was in <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1991 when Oldman was arrested for drunk driving</a>. In 1994, the actor went to rehab and worked on himself, which eventually led to sobriety for more than 20 years. By the way, Oldman played <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Citizen Kane screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz in the movie Mank</a>, who struggled with alcoholism.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=britney-spears>Britney Spears</h2><p>The pop princess had tough times in the 2000s. Unfortunately, she faced a breakdown where she shaved her head after splitting up with her then-husband, Kevin Federline. Before the divorce happened, Spears was a party animal, along with Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan. Because of her "bizarre public behavior" - she could fall asleep at a nightclub or driving drunk. As a result, in 2008, Spears was placed under conservatorship, which <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she's fighting against until now.</a> Despite the challenges she had in her life, the pop star's fans love her and launched the #FreeBritney movement on social media to support her. Also, other celebrities supported her fans, including Paris Hilton, Christina Aguilera, Madonna, and Justin Timberlake.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=daniel-radcliffe>Daniel Radcliffe</h2><p>Being famous from the very childhood can be tricky. Radcliffe couldn't cope with fame which led to the development of alcoholic addiction. "In my case, the quickest way to forget about the fact that you're being watched is to get very drunk," <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he said to Independent.co.uk.</a> Yet, Radcliffe managed to overcome the problem, and he's been sober since 2010. He admitted that he loves his job, and he doesn't regret being <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harry Potter</a>.</p><h2 id=mary-kate-and-ashley-olsen>Mary-Kate And Ashley Olsen</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The twins <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">started her path from childhood</a> as well. The Olsen twins have never denied they had a caffeine addiction. They used to drink a lot of coffee, "When I was younger, on weekends, my mom would make us pancakes with our initials on them and then a tiny cup of coffee," said Ashley. Actually, they started the trend of walking around cities with oversized sunglasses and Starbucks cups.</p><h2 id=sir-elton-john>Sir Elton John</h2><p>A rock legend who made history in the music industry in the 70s faced some challenges as well. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Truant life</a> brought many problems; the rock star was having pain in his chest or spasms. For now, Elton is more than 30 years sober. "I am a survivor," he said. "I've survived a lot of things. Life is full of pitfalls, even when you're sober. I can deal with them now because I don't have to run away and hide."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The fact that celebrities share their stories and experience tells a lot. Facing addiction problems is challenging and consuming, but admitting you have a problem and asking for help is the first step to recovery.</p><p><span class=related-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;</span><span class=related-single><a href=#>Tonight They'll Be Eating: Sir Elton John And Little Nas X Team Up For An Epic Uber Eats Ad</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tribpub</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Reporter</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSyrrHRoKCnn12rtqTAzqugqK2jYoRur8SlnJuqmam2pr%2BMrZ%2BarF2XrrXAy56bZpmUmbakwMiopWg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2femerging-victorious-7-celebrities-that-battled-addiction.html&text=Emerging%20Victorious%3a%207%20Celebrities%20That%20Battled%20Addiction&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2femerging-victorious-7-celebrities-that-battled-addiction.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2femerging-victorious-7-celebrities-that-battled-addiction.html&title=Emerging%20Victorious%3a%207%20Celebrities%20That%20Battled%20Addiction" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2femerging-victorious-7-celebrities-that-battled-addiction.html&title=Emerging%20Victorious%3a%207%20Celebrities%20That%20Battled%20Addiction" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2femerging-victorious-7-celebrities-that-battled-addiction.html&title=Emerging%20Victorious%3a%207%20Celebrities%20That%20Battled%20Addiction" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2femerging-victorious-7-celebrities-that-battled-addiction.html&description=Emerging%20Victorious%3a%207%20Celebrities%20That%20Battled%20Addiction" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jenifer-lewis-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jenifer Lewis Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./charlie-heaton.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Charlie Heaton Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
