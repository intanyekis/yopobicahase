This reality television series put eight "twentysomethings" together in hopes that they would find love, find new life for themselves, or at the very least, hook up. The show was refreshingly drama-free and followed the adventures of these young adults as they explore their new living arrangements and journey through the new relationships and friendships that inevitably developed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The four ladies are housed in one residence, and the four men are right next door - and this is how <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">24-year-old fashion designer Isha Punja, and 23-year-old comedian Michael Fractor </a>hit it off. The season ended ambiguously with fans wondering if this couple remained together, and fans are eager to discover what their relationship status is today.</p><h2 id=isha-punja-and-michael-fractor-39-s-relationship-status-today><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Isha Punja And Michael Fractor's Relationship Status Today</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When episode 12 ended, Michael left Isha to pursue life back in Los Angeles, only to turn right back around again and declare to Isha, and the rest of the world, that he changed his mind and was following his heart instead. When he re-entered the scene, he told Isha he had come back for her, in the most epic and romantic moment, stating<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">, “I’m realizing that a job’s a job. There’s plenty of them out there, but there’s only one Isha.” </a>The problem is, after the show, fans didn't hear anything else from them on social media, and since they haven't gone 'Instagram official,' there's been no actual confirmation that they're an item in real-life.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Netflix's New Korean Dating Show, 'Single's Inferno,' Details Revealed</a></span></p><h2 id=they-could-be-keeping-fans-hooked-so-they-tune-in-for-more><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>They Could Be Keeping Fans Hooked So They Tune In For More</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The fact that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> they left off as boyfriend and girlfriend</a> suggests that Michael Fractor and Isha Punja are a couple and that they're still together. The fact that they haven't made any official announcement about their relationship status could very well be because the producers of the show have asked them not to. It would only make sense that the anticipation would lead to more fans tuning in when Twentysomethings: Austin makes its long-awaited Netflix return.</p><h2 id=michael-fractor-and-isha-punja-still-follow-each-other-on-social-media><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Michael Fractor And Isha Punja Still Follow Each Other On Social Media</span></h2><p>Those looking for hints on whether or not Isha and Michael have continued to build on their love-bond after the cameras stopped rolling will find some clues on the internet. One of the biggest hints that fans have to work with is the simple fact that they still follow one another on social media. Most couples that breakup tend to unfollow one another pretty quickly. Understandably... who wants to see updates from their ex? The fact that they still follow one another is a pretty good sign that things are going well in the love department.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Was Abbey Humphreys Before Joining 'Twentysomethings: Austin'</a></span></p><h2 id=isha-and-michael-share-images-of-each-other><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Isha And Michael Share Images Of Each Other</span></h2><p>Eagle-eyed fans will notice that these two are still sharing images of one another online, which is a solid indication that they're not only still together but are thriving and making memories together. Even if they're not officially a couple, the images they're sharing of one another on social media proves that at the very least, they are very close friend and confirms that they're still spending lots of time with one another and moving forward in a positive direction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michael-fractor-39-s-family-wears-isha-punja-39-s-clothing-line><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Michael Fractor's Family Wears Isha Punja's Clothing Line</span></h2><p>During an emotionally charged episode of Twentysomethings: Austin, Michael went out of his way to purchase a very expensive jacket from Isha's clothing line, Hut Mentality. She was in need of some sales to save her business, and he came to her rescue despite the fact he didn't have much money to spare. That very same jacket has made a social media comeback after Season 12, and it reappeared in the most unexpected way. Michael's sister was seen wearing it, which has led fans to believe that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Isha has perhaps met Michaels' family,</a> or at the very least, they support her and have given their approval.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Cast Of 'Twentysomethings: Austin' Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=isha-makes-references-to-39-misha-moments-39><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Isha Makes References To 'Misha Moments'</span></h2><p>Isha Punja has taken her social media sharing of Michael Fractor's images to the next level, which is a strong indication that she's still smitten with him. She posted a series of images of herself with Michael, then captioned the gallery by writing; "Which Misha moment is your favourite?” Using a nickname to reference the two of them is a pretty good sign that they're not only an official couple, but one with a cute nickname that she seems to be very proud of.</p><h2 id=isha-punja-39-s-linkedin-profile-clue><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Isha Punja's LinkedIn Profile Clue</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Instagram isn't the only online location to find clues. In fact,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Isha's LinkedIn profile</a> happens to be telling fans about her love life, not just her career. It has been updated to reflect that she is located in Los Angeles, which just so happens to be where Michael was headed after the show. Isha had spoken about remaining in Austin, but it would seem she might have followed him to Los Angeles instead, which is very telling and would be the perfect continuation of their story.</p><h2 id=isha-punja-and-michael-fractor-39-s-new-year-39-s-eve><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Isha Punja And Michael Fractor's New Year's Eve</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Staring off a new year together is a very big deal, and Instagram has revealed that Isha and Michael definitely welcomed 2022 together. They posted an adorable image of themselves clearly having a fabulous time together. They were surrounded by friends, and it appears that they started the new year the way they'd like for it to continue... together.</p><h2 id=michael-alludes-to-isha-being-his-girlfriend><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Michael Alludes To Isha Being His Girlfriend</span></h2><p>At the start of the new year, Michael posted an Instagram summary of how 2021 started vs. how 2021 ended. He posted an image without Isha in 2021 and wrote "no girlfriend" as the first point in his summary of how they year began. The image that depicted how the year ended was one of him and Isha together, and that "no girlfriend" status was visibly missing. Isha responded to that post by writing, "Luckiest guy in the world ❤️."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=isha-punja-and-michael-fractor-left-off-as-a-couple><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Isha Punja And Michael Fractor Left Off As A Couple...</span></h2><p>Those looking to string together Isha and Michael's relationship status using facts need not look any further than episode 12. They definitely closed off the show as a couple who was very emotionally connected. Michael's romantic return and the way he emotionally revealed that he came back to pursue a relationship with Isha is the last fact that fans can draw upon. Given that there aren't any official statements to suggest they broke things off, it's reasonable for fans to think the return of Twentysomethings: Austin will include the continuation of this relationship.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>What Is 'Snowflake Mountain'?
