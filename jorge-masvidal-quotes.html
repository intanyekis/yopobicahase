I’ve never called a reporter like, hey, I want to be on your show, book me, you know?” Jorge Masvidal</p><p><strong>70th of 100 Jorge Masvidal Quotes&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“The more I tour the world, the more I see that people are just like me. They love violence.” Jorge Masvidal&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“I’ve been fighting professionally since I was 18, and I’ve been doing three or four fights a year, just doing camp after camp.” Jorge Masvidal</p><p>“I think the sport is growing and along with it weight classes have to be added.” Jorge Masvidal</p><p>“You know I could get hit with a baseball bat and it don’t mean nothing.” Jorge Masvidal</p><p>“I don’t want to fight no up-and-coming guy, no guy that’s 15-0 but hasn’t faced anybody yet.” Jorge Masvidal</p><p>“I do not want to fight Woodley because we’re cool.

But once you’re already at the top of your game, you’re in there, man. That’s it.” Jorge Masvidal</p><p><a href=#>38 Bobby Orr Quotes that will inspire you</a></p><p>“My coaches know when it’s a big fight, I’m at the gym because if they give me some pretender, another actor, I might not take it.” Jorge Masvidal</p><p>“For some reason, that’s the title they’re giving me: ”The Ultimate Fighter’ Destroyer.’” Jorge Masvidal</p><p>“I’ve got more mat hours than most of the guys who are grapplers got on the mat.” Jorge Masvidal</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Jorge-Masvidal-quote-on-school.png><p>“I want to get paid for my services.” Jorge Masvidal</p><p>“The things that I rely on, USADA doesn’t have a problem with them.

There’s no hard feelings if me and hit had to scrap.” Jorge Masvidal</p><p>“Over everything, over friendships or anything, is my kids – and obviously fighting for that belt is my kids’ future. It doesn’t sound too nice, but if my mom had the belt, she better give it up because my kids gotta eat. If I’m willing to fight my mom, imagine a good friend.” Jorge Masvidal</p><p><strong>90th of 100 Jorge Masvidal Quotes&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p><p>“Back in the day, you used to have to fight three or four fights in one night with no dodging nobody, and that’s what the sport got built on.” Jorge Masvidal&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“I never think past any man, because every guy has two hands and every dude wants to hurt you.” Jorge Masvidal</p><p>“I’m not involved in too many wars, where I’m just constantly getting hit, hit, hit.” Jorge Masvidal</p><p><a href=#>30 Famous Barry Sanders Quotes for success</a></p><p>“It’s a blessing and a curse.

We’ve worked out together plenty. He’s one of the guys who used to slam me all around the place. I was at 155, he was at 170 pounds and he was just the wrestler that is a superpower.
