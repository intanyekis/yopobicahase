An avid sportsman even as a kid, Mills loved to play the game called tag with his older brother.</p><p>Sam was also frequently seen playing pickup football with the older boys in the neighborhood.</p><p>Despite retiring, this sporty streak did not leave him all his life as he went on to be connected to the game as a coach.</p><p>Sam Mills studied at Long Branch High School and was a brilliant football player and wrestler.</p><p>There, he got recognized for his skills on the football field and in the ring; hence, he was appreciated and the best in his high school.</p><p>Notably, his high school has hanged his NFL jersey in the gym as an honor and a tribute to him and his brilliance in the game of football.</p><h2>How tall was Sam Mills? Age, Height, and Body Measurements</h2><p>The highly inspiring and legendary Sam Mills fell on the shorter side of the height spectrum.</p><p>Falling just a little under 5 ft 10 inches, Mills was overlooked numerous times as people considered his height a flaw.</p><p>His large physique at 105 kgs might seem too much, but it was perfect for a defensive linebacker for a footballer in the USFL and the NFL.</p><p>He overcame the height barrier through his excellent gameplay and lightning speed later in his life, which earned him multiple honors throughout his life.</p><h2>Sam Mills | College Career</h2><p>Sam Mills attended Montclair State University, previously known as Montclair State College, from 1977 to 1980.</p><p>Mills is the all-time leader for career tackles with a whopping 501 kits.</p><p>He was named NJAC First Team All-Star three times and won the New Jersey Collegiate Writers Defensive Player of the Year three years consecutively from 1978 to 1980.</p><p>Despite performing brilliantly all through college, he was not paid much attention to by the NFL scouts because of his relatively short stature of 5ft 9 inches.</p><p>In 1981, Mills became an undrafted free agent and signed with Cleveland Browns.
