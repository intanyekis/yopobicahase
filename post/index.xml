その知名度は日に日に向上して言っており、
メディア出演でのバンド人気の加熱が期待されてます。
もともとwanimaは多くの熱狂的なファンを抱え、
多くのフェスで一番大きなステージに立ってきました。
３ピースバンドの中では最もパワフルに、
さらにはハートフルな演奏を持ち味にしてますが、
その楽曲を支えるドラムのFUJIさんの存在は大きいです。
常に強いドラムで、
観客の心を虜にしてますが、
一般的な知名度はケンタさんに偏ります。
それでも紅白が決まってメディアにメンバーの名前が踊るようになると、
ふじさんの話題も出るようになりました。
最近では、紅白に向けて１０キロのダイエットをしたことを明かしました。
WANIMAのFUJI(藤原弘樹)が10キロ減のダイエット フジさんのダイエットがニュースになったのは、
紅白の２日前の１２月２９日にリハーサルに登場した時でした。
ドラムのフジさんはここ最近、
食べ過ぎで徐々にぽっちゃり気味に・・笑。
ファン的には何も問題なかったのですが、
フジさん本人は少なからず気にしていたようで、
紅白に向けて、まさかの１０キロのダイエットを告白しました。
ドラムのＦＵＪＩ（３１）はこの日のために１０キロ減量したことも告白。「衣装が入らなかったんで…」と苦笑いしたが、「（紅白への）思いダイエットです」とその熱い思いを明かした。
まるで１０年ぶりに会う同窓会に備える女子のようで、
可愛いと思いますが、フジさんはもともと繊細で優しい方なので、
ファンの間は「やりそ〜」と反応も多かったそうです。
紅白でお得意のハートフルなステージを披露してくれると思いますが、
かなり痩せたフジさんにも注目してみたいです！
ただ、あのパワフルなドラムが弱っていないか、
少なからず極端な減量を懸念する声もあります・・・、
持ち前の力強いドラムが健在であることを祈ります。。笑
WANIMAのドラム・FUJI(藤原弘樹)の彼女と結婚と出身中学高校大学(画像) WANIMAは熊本出身のバンドということで、
多くの熊本県民が応援しています。
ある意味熊本の希望の光的存在なので、
これから注目は長く続くと思いますが、
紅白に出場するということで、
音楽以外のことへの関心も深まると思います。
昨年はラッドウィンプスが紅白に出場し、
元旦にボーカルの野田氏が前田敦子と熱愛してるよようなガセ報道がありました。
WANIMAも女性関係を気をつけないと、
今後、週刊誌に変なネタを書かれてしまいそうです・・・笑。
ドラムのフジさんは特に優しくて面白い方なので、
多くの女性ファンを抱えます。
１９８６年８月８日生まれということで、
夏生まれの明るい方で、しかも血液型はO型！
ステータスだけ見てるモテモテな空気感がありますね・・笑。
それでもWANIMAというバンド自体、
ファンの女性に手を出すような話はなく、
バンギャとの関係の多いヴィジュアル系などとは対面にあるバンドです。
過去にラジオ番組の中で、
「フジにはそういうフレンドは何人いるか」という問題がリスナーに出され、
「いっぱい」という答えに対して、ほかメンバーが「正解！」と悪ふざけするシーンもありました。
その時にフジさんは、全く正解ではないと強く講義しており、
普段の女っ気のなさが生々しく出る格好となっていました。。笑
それでもモテることには間違いないと思いので、
遊ぶことはなくても、コンスタンディングに彼女ぐらいはいそうです。
これから紅白出場などで、
メジャー級のメジャー級にバンドが育てば、
結婚するメンバーも出てくると思いますが、
意外にも、フジさんが一番最初に嫁をもらうかも？
昔からバンドはドラムが最初に結婚するジンクスがありますからね！笑
ちなみにフジさんの出身高校は野球の名門の九州学院と噂されていますが、今のところ本人からは公表されていないので、事実かはわかりません。
地元の高校を卒業して、大学ではなくて専門学校を卒業されているそうです。
