The song's protagonist begins to notice strange inconsistencies in her partner's behavior and begins to question whether he is who he says he is. She checks his clothes, his car, and even his sleeping spot, but still cannot figure out the truth. The sense of confusion and loss is palpable throughout the song.</p><br><p>Tamia's smooth and sultry voice adds to the atmosphere of vulnerability and doubt. She sings of the uncertainty of finding a stranger in her home, and the lyrics take on an increasingly desperate tone as she searches for answers. The lines "tell me where we first kissed" and "tell me where my spot is" hint at the depth of the betrayal and the loss she is experiencing.</p><br><p>In summary, the song is a powerful example of the emotional turmoil that can arise when trust is violated. The singer's struggle to come to terms with her feelings is evident, and the song leaves the listener with a sense of unease and a desire to know more.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>I don't understand</u><br>The singer is expressing confusion about the person in her house</p><br><p><u>You look just like the man</u><br>The person in her house physically resembles her partner</p><br><p><u>In the picture by our bed</u><br>There is a photo of her partner next to their bed to compare their appearance</p><br><p><u>The suspense is pounding and clouding up my head</u><br>She is feeling anxious and nervous about the situation</p><br><p><u>I'm checking your clothes</u><br>She is examining the clothes of the person in her house</p><br><p><u>And you wear the same size shoe</u><br>The person in her house wears the same shoe size as her partner</p><br><p><u>You sleep in his spot and you're driving his car</u><br>The person in her house is taking on the role of her partner, even sleeping in their spot and using their car</p><br><p><u>But I don't know just who you are</u><br>Despite the similarities, she is uncertain about the true identity of the person in her house</p><br><p><u>There's a stranger in my house</u><br>The main idea of the song, the singer believes there is a stranger impersonating her partner in her home</p><br><p><u>It took a while to figure out</u><br>She didn't immediately realize that something was wrong</p><br><p><u>You got to be someone else</u><br>She is convinced that the person in her house is not her partner</p><br><p><u>'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that</u><br>The person in her house is behaving towards her in a way that is different from her partner</p><br><p><u>And he wouldn't treat me like you do (you do)</u><br>The way the person in her house is treating her is not what she would expect from her partner</p><br><p><u>He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me</u><br>Her partner would never ignore her, but the person in her house is not giving her the same attention</p><br><p><u>So I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house</u><br>The chorus is repeated to emphasize her belief that her partner has been replaced by a stranger</p><br><p><u>Don't see your shadow around when you walk</u><br>The singer is noticing small details that don't add up, such as the person in her house not casting a shadow when they walk</p><br><p><u>You're leaving no kisses</u><br>The person in her house is not showing her affection in the way that her partner would</p><br><p><u>Goodbye with no words</u><br>The person in her house is not communicating with her in the way she would expect from her partner</p><br><p><u>If these walls could talk</u><br>The singer is wondering if the walls could tell her anything about the situation</p><br><p><u>They would have nothing to tell</u><br>The walls are not revealing anything useful to her</p><br><p><u>Is there someone imitating me</u><br>The singer is wondering if the person in her house is trying to impersonate her as well</p><br><p><u>Could she be taking my place</u><br>The singer imagines the possibility of someone taking over her life completely</p><br><p><u>And tell me that I'm wrong when I say</u><br>She is asking the person in her house to confront her and tell her that she is wrong</p><br><p><u>Pop quiz</u><br>The singer is setting up a hypothetical test for her partner to prove their identity</p><br><p><u>Tell me where we first kissed</u><br>One of the questions in the test, to see if the person in her house knows intimate details of their relationship</p><br><p><u>Tell me if I like it, love it</u><br>Another question in the test, to confirm if the person in her house knows her preferences</p><br><p><u>Or could it be</u><br>The singer is considering other possibilities for the situation</p><br><p><u>That the stranger is me</u><br>She is questioning if perhaps she is the one who has changed in the relationship</p><br><p><u>Have I changed so drastically</u><br>The singer is questioning if she has changed in a way that has caused the confusion</p><br><p><u>Is it I want more for me</u><br>She is wondering if her desire for more in life has affected her relationship</p><br><p><u>And you remain the same</u><br>The singer is contrasting her own changes with her partner's supposed lack of change</p><br><p><u>Oh yeah</u><br>An affirmative exclamation to emphasize the overall message of the song</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Wixen Music Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group<br>Written by: Anthony S.
